    (Brother Robert Lambert was invited to preach at Brother Coleman’s church in New York.)
    (Brother Lambert dedicates & prays for children)
     It is certainly wonderful to feel the anointing of the Holy Spirit. I don’t know of any place in
    the United States or in the world for that matter, that I would count it more and esteemeth a great
    privilege to be here this morning to preach to a people that are contending for the faith that was
    once delivered to the Saints.
    Jude 1:3-Reference quote:
    3 Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation, it was needful
    for me to write unto you, and exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was
    once delivered unto the saints.
     Because that we have seen that there has been a man in this hour, who has found the faith of
    the Early Apostolic Fathers. And because that our eyes have seen and our ears have heard and
    have witnessed one of the mightiest shakings that this earth has ever had, through a servant of
    God William Branham. And so, this has inspired our faith, to contend for that same faith that he
    has found.
     I am surely and most happily to believe that I have that same Faith this morning, because I
    believe the same message and the same word that was delivered unto him. So, I have
    experienced the restoration of the mighty resurrection power of Jesus Christ in my life this
    morning. I believe that I have, not that I will have, but I have the Faith of Jesus Christ!
     I’d like to hear everybody say here this morning, that have received the Baptism of the Holy
    Ghost, then the Bible said, “That God had dealt to every man a portion of Faith.”
    Romans 12:3-6-Reference quote:
    3 For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of
    himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to
    every man the measure of faith.
    4 For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office:
    5 So we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another.
    6 Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us
    prophesy according to the proportion of faith;
    Then You have the faith of Jesus Christ! Say it, “I have the Faith of Jesus Christ! I believe the
    word of God!”

    William Marrion Branham
    271 Now, there’s only one way to make It fail, that is, for you not to believe It. If Jesus stood
    here Himself and would pray for you, and go through the same act that we have done this
    morning, no more would happen. Or, if you would believe with the measure of faith, that, no
    more could happen than what will happen, if you believe with the same measure of faith.
    Because, I only represent Him. I’m a sinner saved by grace, just a man like you are, just a
    human being. But God has to have an outlet somewhere. And HE’S PROVED THAT BY HIS
    WORD. He’s proved it by the ministry. He’s proved it by the Angel of the Lord. And here it is.
    NOW IT’S UP TO US, TO BELIEVE IT.

    William Marrion Branham
    In Acts 3:16 when Peter was asked how the mighty miracle had taken place upon the crippled
    one at the Gate Beautiful, he explained it on this wise, “And His (Jesus) Name through faith in
    His (Jesus) Name hath made this man (former cripple) strong, yea the faith which is by (from)
    Him (Jesus) hath given him (the man) this perfect soundness in the presence of you all.” See,
    there it is. Jesus’ Name, and Jesus’ Faith brought about the miracle. Peter did not claim it was
    his own human faith any more than he claimed that it was his own name. He said that Jesus’
    Name used in the faith which is from Jesus performed that great work. This faith is what the
    Lord was speaking about in Revelation 2:13. It was HIS faith. It was not faith IN Him. BUT IT
    WAS HIS OWN FAITH THAT HE HAD GIVEN TO THE BELIEVERS. Romans 12:3,
    “According as God hath dealt to every man” (according to verse 1 the men are BRETHREN)
    “the measure of faith.” Ephesians 2:8, “By grace are ye saved through faith; and that (Faith)
    not of yourself: IT IS A GIFT OF GOD.” And it also says in James 2:1, “My brethren,” (notice
    he, too, is talking to BRETHREN), “have not the faith OF (not in) our Lord Jesus Christ with
    respect of persons.”

    61-1231E - If God Be With Us, Then Where Is All The Miracles?
    William Marrion Branham
    53 Now I want you to notice another thing that might encourage you. IMMEDIATELY AFTER
    THAT PROPHET’S MESSAGE, THE LORD APPEARED ON THE SCENE. Amen! As soon
    as he gave his Message, the Lord appeared under a tree. The Lord came, after the Message of
    the prophet, sitting under a tree. THE PROPHET GAVE…THE PEOPLE FELL AWAY, GOT
    OFF IN THEIR ISMS. GOD SENT HIS PROPHET. SOON AS THE PROPHET GOT
    THROUGH WITH HIS MESSAGE, THE LORD FOLLOWED THE PROPHET’S
    MESSAGE, FOR DELIVERANCE! 54 Oh, we are living in a grand time! Immediately when
    the prophet went off the scene, what happened? THE LORD CAME ON THE SCENE! AS
    SOON AS JOHN WENT OFF THE SCENE, THE LORD CAME ON THE SCENE! Very
    strange how God works, but He does it, works in mysterious way.
    
    3
     Well, anything can happen…Not able to Transcribe, for loud praises… Amen!
     As I was back there praying…you know sometimes you ever smell apple pie baking? It
    smells good, don’t it? Well, I smelt apostolic power this morning! I tell ya, it got so real just like
    I knew the pie was in the oven. I believe that we’re ready and is at the door, God is ready to give
    us here in New York city an apostolic assembly, with the power of the Holy Ghost a moving
    among his people.
    That the people might know that God has had a prophet in this day to restore us the same viable
    deliverance that the apostles had.
     As Brother Anthony preached so wonderfully the other night, we’re not preaching another
    gospel, were preaching The Gospel! We’re preaching The Gospel, which is the revelation of the
    Faith! Right? It is the revelation. And you can’t be drug into it and you can’t join into it. You
    have to be revelated into it. Comes by revelation!

    65-1204 - The Rapture
    William Marrion Branham
    But when you see these things begin to happen, raise up your head, get ready. Something could
    happen at any time, Christ come for His Church. 63 Now, they don’t believe it, because it is
    a…it’s a…They, they’re suppo-…They don’t realize that they’re the ones that’s fulfilling the
    Scriptures. The people really don’t realize that, doing these things and saying these things,
    they’re fulfilling the Scriptures. How little did Caiaphas, the high priest, and all those priests in
    that day, that scoffed and made fun of Him, didn’t know that, the very God that they were singing
    about, “My God, why has Thou forsaken Me?” The 22nd Psalm, “My hands and My feet they
    pierced.” Singing that in the temple, and Him dying out there on the cross. Little did they know
    they were doing it. Even Jesus prayed, “Father, forgive them. They don’t know what they’re
    doing.” Because, they were actually predicted, by the Scriptures, to be blind. 64 Did you know
    the Protestant and Catholic church is predicted, in the last days, to be blind, the same thing, to
    the Scriptures, WITH CHRIST ON THE OUTSIDE, TRYING TO GET IN? “Because thou
    sayest, ‘I am rich, and have need of nothing,’ KNOWEST THOU NOT THAT THOU ART
    MISERABLE, POOR, WRETCHED, NAKED, AND BLIND, AND DON’T KNOW IT,”
    Revelation 3. There you are, back to the blindness again, trampling over the things of God, as if
    (they) It didn’t mean nothing to them, scoffing and making fun of It. That’s what the Bible said.
    65 But, to the Church, the Bride, the Rapture is a revelation to Her. It’s revealed to Her. That,
    the revelation, the TRUE BRIDE OF CHRIST WILL BE WAITING FOR THAT
    REVELATION of the Rapture. 66 NOW, IT IS A REVELATION, FOR THE REVELATION
    IS FAITH. YOU CANNOT HAVE A REVELATION WITHOUT IT BEING FAITH. FAITH
    IS A REVELATION, BECAUSE IT’S SOMETHING THAT’S REVEALED TO YOU. FAITH
    IS A REVELATION. FAITH IS SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN REVEALED TO YOU,
    like it was to Abraham, that could call anything contrary to what had been revealed to him, as
    though it wasn’t so. NOW, FAITH, THAT’S WHAT FAITH IS, IS THE REVELATION OF
    GOD. THE CHURCH IS BUILT UPON A REVELATION, THE WHOLE ENTIRE BODY.

    An Exposition Of The Seven Church Ages - 5 - The Pergamean Church Age
    William Marrion Branham
    And there it is. You CAN’T claim that manifestation is the evidence of being Spirit-born, Spiritfilled. No sir. I will admit that true manifestation is the evidence of the Holy Spirit doing mighty
    acts, but it is NOT the evidence of the individual being Spirit-filled, even though that individual
    has an abundance of those manifestations. The evidence of receiving the Holy Ghost today is just
    the same as it was back in the day of our Lord. IT IS RECEIVING THE WORD OF TRUTH
    FOR THE DAY IN WHICH YOU LIVE. JESUS NEVER DID STRESS THE IMPORTANCE
    OF THE WORKS AS HE DID THE WORD. HE KNEW THAT IF THE PEOPLE GOT THE
    WORD THE WORKS WOULD FOLLOW. That is Bible. Now Jesus knew that there was going
    to be a terrible drift away from the Word in the Pergamean Age which was as yet two hundred
    years off from the Patmos vision. He knew that drift would cause them to go into the Dark Ages.
    He knew that the way man originally got away from God was by first leaving the Word. If you
    leave that Word, you have left God. Thus He is presenting Himself to the church at Pergamos,
    and indeed to all churches of all ages, “I AM THE WORD. IF YOU WANT DEITY IN YOUR
    MIDST, THEN WELCOME AND RECEIVE THE WORD. Don’t ever let anyone or anything
    get between you and that Word. THIS WHICH I AM GIVING YOU (THE WORD) IS A
    REVELATION OF MYSELF. I AM THE WORD. REMEMBER THAT!” I wonder if we are
    sufficiently impressed with the Word in our midst. Let me give you a thought here. How do we
    pray? We pray in Jesus Name don’t we? Every prayer is in His Name or there isn’t any answer.
    Yet in I John 5:14 we are told, “This is the confidence that we have in Him, that, if we ask
    anything according to His will, He heareth us: and if we know that He hear us, whatsoever we
    ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of Him.” Now we ask, “What is the will
    of God?” There is only ONE WAY to know His will and that is by the WORD OF GOD.
    Lamentations 3:37, “Who is he that saith, and it cometh to pass, when the Lord commandeth it
    not?” There it is. If it isn’t in the Word you can’t have it. So we can’t ask unless it’s in the Word,
    and we can’t petition or ask unless it is in His Name. There it is again. JESUS (the Name) is the
    WORD (will). You can’t separate God and the Word. They are ONE. Now then, this Word He
    has left behind on the printed page is a part of HIM WHEN YOU ACCEPT IT BY FAITH
    into a Spirit-filled life. He said that His Word was life. John 6:63b. But that is exactly what He
    is: John 14:6, “I AM THE WAY, THE TRUTH, AND THE LIFE.” Romans 8:9b, “If any man
    have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of His.” There it is, He is Spirit and He is Life. That is
    exactly what the Word is; that is exactly what Jesus is. He is the Word. SO WHEN A SPIRITBORN, SPIRIT-FILLED MAN IN FAITH TAKES THAT WORD INTO HIS HEART AND
    PLACES IT UPON HIS LIPS, WHY THAT IS THE SAME AS DEITY SPEAKING. EVERY
    MOUNTAIN HAS TO GO. SATAN CANNOT STAND BEFORE THAT MAN. If the church,
    way back there in that third age had only held on to the revelation of the living Word in their
    midst, the power of God would not have faded as it did in those Dark Ages. AND RIGHT
    TODAY, WHEN THE CHURCH RETURNS TO THE WORD IN FAITH, WE CAN SAY
    WITHOUT DOUBT THAT THE GLORY OF GOD AND THE WONDERFUL ACTS OF
    GOD WILL BE IN HER MIDST AGAIN. One night as I was seeking the Lord, the Holy Spirit
    told me to pick up my pen and write. As I grasped the pen to write, His Spirit gave me a message
    for the church. I want to bring it to you. It has to do with the Word and the bride. Here is what I
    am trying to say to you. The law of reproduction is that each specie brings forth after its own
    
    5
    kind, even according to Genesis 1:11, “And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, and the
    herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the
    earth: and it was so.” Whatever life was in the seed came forth into a plant and thence into fruit.
    The very same law applies to the church today. Whatever seed started the church will come forth
    and be like the original seed because it is the same seed. IN THESE LAST DAYS THE TRUE
    BRIDE CHURCH (CHRIST’S SEED) WILL COME TO THE HEADSTONE, AND SHE
    WILL BE THE SUPER CHURCH, A SUPER RACE, AS SHE NEARS HIM. THEY IN THE
    BRIDE WILL BE SO MUCH LIKE HIM THAT THEY WILL EVEN BE IN HIS VERY
    IMAGE. THIS IS IN ORDER TO BE UNITED WITH HIM. THEY WILL BE ONE. THEY
    WILL BE THE VERY MANIFESTATION OF THE WORD OF THE LIVING GOD.
    Denominations cannot produce this (wrong seed). They will produce their creeds and their
    dogmas, mixed with the Word. This mongrelizing brings forth a hybrid product. The first son
    (Adam) was the spoken seed-Word of God. HE WAS GIVEN A BRIDE TO REPRODUCE
    HIMSELF. THAT IS WHY THE BRIDE WAS GIVEN TO HIM, TO REPRODUCE
    HIMSELF; TO PRODUCE ANOTHER SON OF GOD. But she fell. She fell by hybridization.
    She caused him to die. THE SECOND SON (JESUS), ALSO A SPOKEN SEED-WORD OF
    GOD WAS GIVEN A BRIDE LIKE AS WAS ADAM. But before He could marry her, she also
    had fallen. She, like Adam’s wife, was put to the test whether she would believe the Word of God
    and live, or doubt the Word and die. She doubted. She left the Word. She died. From a little
    group of the true seed of the Word, God will present Christ with a beloved bride. She is a
    virgin of His Word. She is a virgin because she knows no man-made creeds or dogmas. By and
    through the members of the bride will be fulfilled all that was promised of God to be made
    manifest in the virgin. The word of promise came to the virgin Mary. But that Word of
    promise was He, Himself, to be made manifest. God was made manifest. He, Himself, acted at
    that time and fulfilled His own Word of promise in the virgin. It was an angel that had
    brought her the message. But the angel’s message was the Word of God. Isaiah 9:6. He
    fulfilled at that time all that was written of Him because SHE ACCEPTED HIS WORD TO
    HER. The members of the virgin bride will love Him, and they will have His potentials, for He
    is their head, and all power belongs to Him. They are subject to Him as the members of our
    bodies are subject to our heads. Notice the harmony of the Father and the Son. Jesus never did
    anything until it was first showed Him by the Father. John 5:19. This harmony is now to exist
    between the Groom and His bride. HE SHOWS HER HIS WORD OF LIFE. SHE
    RECEIVES IT. She never doubts it. Therefore, nothing can harm her, not even death. FOR
    IF THE SEED BE PLANTED, THE WATER WILL RAISE IT UP AGAIN. HERE IS THE
    SECRET OF THIS. THE WORD IS IN THE BRIDE (AS IT WAS IN MARY). THE BRIDE
    HAS THE MIND OF CHRIST FOR SHE KNOWS WHAT HE WANTS DONE WITH THE
    WORD. She performs the command of the Word in His name for she has “thus saith the
    Lord.” Then the Word is quickened by the Spirit and it comes to pass. Like a seed that is
    planted and watered, it comes to full harvest, serving its purpose. Those in the bride do only His
    will. No one can make them do otherwise. They have “thus saith the Lord” or they keep still.
    They know that it has to be God in them doing the works, fulfilling His own Word. HE DID NOT
    COMPLETE ALL HIS WORK WHILE IN HIS EARTHLY MINISTRY SO NOW HE
    WORKS IN AND THROUGH THE BRIDE. She knows that, for it was not yet time for Him to
    do certain things that He must now do. BUT HE WILL NOW FULFILL THROUGH THE
    BRIDE THAT WORK WHICH HE LEFT FOR THIS SPECIFIC TIME.

     I would like to teach this morning…Oh brother George, I wish you would of put a little strip
    on here to hold my notes. Amen! I would like to teach a Sunday school lesson this morning. You
    know I love to preach! But I think that most of us here know the Lord Jesus as their personal
    savior.
     And it has been said by the messenger of the hour, “That preaching catches the sinner.”
    Teaching shows the church where she is and what you are.”

    6 Bible teaching is usually a little treacherous, a little, you know, kind of walking out on the thin
    ice, we call it. But we just feel that maybe, at this point and at this time, it might be good to kind
    of bring the—the church to what I think, to a—a complete understanding, positionally, of
    what we are in Christ Jesus. And sometimes I think that preaching is a wonderful thing, but I
    believe sometimes, Brother Beeler, that teaching goes beyond that, it kindly…especially to the
    church. Now, preaching usually catches the sinner, brings him under condemnation by the
    Word. But teaching places the man positionally what he is. And we can never rightly be able to
    have faith until positionally we know what we are.
     So, I think, that if we are going to have an apostolic church, then it depends upon you. Not
    just him or her but you! First you let this be done in your life. See! Don’t wait for it to be done in
    somebody else.
     So, I believe that if God would help us to teach this sixth chapter of Romans this morning,
    that I think…You know, I want to say something this morning, not to just stir you up and get you
    blessed but I want something to anchor down in you. Tomorrow, that maybe Brother George will
    say, “You know Brother Bob you know that message that the Lord let you minister, I tell ya, I
    see the fruit of it.” And that’s what I’m looking for is the fruit in my what ministering that the
    Lord would enable me to do, no matter how small it would be, I would like to see fruit from it.
    Amen! Is that right? (Amen)
     We’re not the type of Christian that just want the type of service and we have the power of
    God blessing us. We just want to feel the power of God on us and go home. But we want to get
    something down in us that we can have this resurrection power daily and in every meeting. And
    it’s solely the power of God anointing of the Holy Spirit depends upon you and I. You and I in
    this assembly have control of whether or not the Holy Spirit is gonna be here to bless us every
    time we come. Just one person can keep the Holy Spirit out of our midst.
     So, let us with a reverence and a sincere attitude try to get something from this lesson this
    morning, that will enable us to be better Christians. Amen! That’s what we want.
     Now we don’t have to be afraid that this power of the Lord Jesus Christ in our midst that
    we’re gonna see. But I’m here to tell you this morning, that it will get greater and greater, greater
    and greater. I don’t believe there is one here this morning that has a mind to understand or
    comprehend how great God is going to pour out his power upon those who are contending, not
    for a compromising gospel so that they can get big crowds and be well spoken of, but those who
    
    7
    are willing to be persecuted for the sake of the word of God, shall receive the greatest anointing
    and the greatest power that’s ever been put upon the church of Jesus Christ.
    Romans 8:18-19-Reference quote:
    18 For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the
    glory which shall be revealed in us.
    19 For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God.

    62 I BELIEVE THAT THE CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD IS MOVING INTO A
    SPHERE NOW THAT’S GOING TO SHAKE THE WHOLE WORLD. That’s the first time
    it’s been since the days of Jesus of Nazareth to a human being. “Ask anything that you will, and
    it shall be given unto you, anything you desire.” Don’t you see the words of Jesus Christ being
    fulfilled? Oh, it’s going to come to pass pretty soon. I’m looking for it to happen in this meeting.
    I’m wanting it to happen now, THAT THAT ANOINTING WILL STRIKE THE WHOLE
    CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD, AND SHE’LL RISE TO HER FEET LIKE A MIGHTY
    MARCHING ARMY. THE SICK WILL BE HEALED BY A WORD; THE BLIND WILL
    SEE; THE DEAF WILL HEAR; THE DEAD WILL BE RAISED UP; AND THE POWER
    OF GOD WILL SHAKE THE WORLD WITH THE CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD.
    We’re in the process of it now. I believe it’s soon coming to pass. I believe it will be just exactly
    that way. I BELIEVE IT’S GOING TO STRIKE THE CHURCH OF GOD SOON, AND IT’S
    GOING TO START A REVIVAL THAT’LL SHAKE THE WORLD. I BELIEVE IT.
    
     If you will now open your Bibles now to the Sixth chapter of Romans. Now I hope, that you
    will read this chapter when you get home in your study with the Lord and that it will become real
    to you.
     Now the subject that I would like to teach on this morning…and God help me to be able to
    pace myself through this. I don’t minister hardly anymore, just ministering once every four or
    five months, it’s like almost, the devil would tell ya, “Well you wasn’t even called in the first
    place.” So, it’s just like starting to minister all over again. So, you pray for me, won’t you?

     “I am a servant of God, a preacher of the gospel, this morning, not because I will. No! I was
    laying there dying in the Veterans hospital and HE COME TO ME AND SAID, “I LOVE YOU,
    I CALLED YOU TO BE MY SERVANT.” And I said, “Oh, I believed it, yes, Lord, I believed it

     You know I lived in Florida then and did a lot of fishin, and I know how many grains of sands
    are over there, boy. A lot of beach over there. AND THE LORD JESUS SPOKE TO ME AND
    SAID… “OUT OF ALL…” SEE, I DIDN’T KNOW THAT WAS IN THE SCRIPTURE.
    SEE! AND HE SAID, “OUT OF ALL THEM GRAINS OF SAND ON THE SEA SHORE I
    CALLED YOU!” Oh, it just caught me away, I loved it. It just caught me away, but I believed
    it. I believed with all my heart and I receive it. So, it’s eternally secure. He didn’t call me
    because I wanted to be a preacher. I didn’t want to be a preacher, Why, That’s the last thing I’d
    wanna be! Oh my, I was scared to death of preachers, the gospel and all that. But it’s His good
    pleasure, and His will. Why? For you? Why? It was His good pleasure to call me to be His
    minister, What For? For you here in Durham, Connecticut.”
     I’d like to try to teach this subject this morning by the help of the Lord and call it, if you want
    to make a note on it, “The Believer… “The believer and the isolation of his Evil Nature”
     Now every individual that is born into this world has evil impulses. Heredity and
    environment, education and circumstances all play a very important…important part in one’s
    behavior.
     The average individual however doesn’t allow too many of these, evil impulses to run
    rampaging through his experience. But there are some impulses in his everyday life as a believer
    that he has no control over! And with all of the power that he is able to muster, he is unable to
    put them out of his life!
     Now in the word of God this morning, I believe we will be able to find a way of deliverance
    for these evil impulses that is so holding us back from going on two greater heights and greater
    depths with the Lord Jesus Christ! In the word of God, we will find deliverance this morning for
    these things.

    Oh, my. DELIVERANCE ON THE ROAD. Yes, sir. Just as soon as He gets an order,
    deliverance is there. He’s setting the picture together now for a great drama. I believe that God
    that lived in Moses’ time is the same Jehovah today. And I believe now that the Holy Spirit has
    come upon the Church, calling the people out, getting them ready. The word “church” means
    “called out.” God’s called out of every denomination a people, cleansing them from their sins,
    filling them with the Holy Spirit, setting them aside for service, for the great march is
    coming.
     I believe that every problem that you and I have can be answered in the word of God, by
    looking at it and digesting we can find a solution to our problems. I believe when you leave here
    this morning, you’ll be a new person, as part of looking at the word of God.
     Now in the medical world we often hear of a medical advertisement and probably you have
    taken it. Called a four-way coat-tail which attacks a cold germ four different ways.
    
    9
     Now this we would like this morning to speak of the power of God that attacks sin in three
    different ways. Is that right? (Amen)
     Now the medical world speaks of a disease germ, you’ve heard them speak of a germ, they’re
    looking for a germ. Speaks of a disease germ that has not been isolated. Now this means that if
    they can ever isolate this germ out from among the rest of the germs that they have isolated, it is
    very easy for them to enable their selves to find a medicine which will kill that germ.
     And by the Grace of God this morning, if we can isolate our trouble in this Evil Nature, we
    can find a deterrent to it and that’s the power of the Holy Ghost! We’ll be able to kill this germ
    by the power of God, finding our trouble in the word of God. Now you understand that? We’re
    gonna isolate this this Evil Nature this morning by the word of God. Remember now, if we can
    ever get it isolated where we can look at it, we can just pulverize it and kill it, kill it out stamp it
    out.
     Now…now the Christian who has never been able to isolate… speaking of myself now.
    Never been able to isolate this evil nature, he is fighting an opponent as a… is fighting
    something that he don’t know about, he can’t see it. And you cannot see this Evil Nature, you
    cannot feel this Evil Nature, but it is there never-the-less. Is that right? (Amen)
     But if we’re going to be continually ignorant to this Evil Nature which we have, then we’ll be
    able to do nothing about and you will pay a terrible consequence because you don’t find out what
    it is.
     Now the first of all let us appraise the character of the sinful nature! Turn your Bibles very
    quickly, Brother Joe get Genesis 6:5 and Brother Hunt you get Romans 3:10 and Anthony you
    get Galatians 5:19. Brother Joe very hurriedly now would you read Genesis 6:5 so we can move
    right along. (Brother Coleman reads) Brother Hunt! (Brother Hunt reads) Brother Anthony!
    Genesis 6:5-Scripture reading by Brother Coleman
    5 And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of
    the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.
    Romans 3:10-Scripture Reading by Brother Hunt
    10 As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:
    Galatians 5:19-21-Scripture Reading by Brother Anthony
    19 Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness,
    lasciviousness,
    20 Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,
    21 Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I
    have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of
    God.
     Amen! “Those that do things such as this, that you’ve heard of shall not inherit the Kingdom
    of God.” Is that right? (Amen!) this is the a…the Evil Nature, the works of the Evil Nature.
    That’s what we’re going to call this the Evil Nature.
     Now…now I want to get a point over to you right now, that you’ll… so you won’t forget it.
    Many of us have judged one another, I have myself. I’ve looked at people that done such things
    and judged them. And said, “Probably that they were false, they didn’t even have any salvation
    or nothing else.” When I did that, I put myself right under the Law! Because I want to drive a
    
    10
    point home to you this morning to stop that. Because I want to ask you something Brother and
    Sister. Which is the worse in the sight of God, adulterer a fornicator or a thief, or a liar or
    covetousness or hatred, or one that had envy or the one that had strife? Which one of those are
    the worse in the sight of God? Huh! (Someone says Envy) All right then! If you would judge
    another brother anything in his life then you put yourself under the Law!
     We are not under the Law we’re under grace! That’ll make us love one another then, don’t it?
    Now who are you that judgeth another man’s servant then? See what you do? When you judge a
    person, you take yourself right out and you’ve falleth from Grace. Is that right? (Amen) Is that
    right ministers? (Amen)
    Romans 14:4-Reference quote:
    4 Who art thou that judgest another man's servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth. Yea,
    he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him stand.
    1 Corinthians 2:15-Reference quote:
    15 But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man.
     Now the Evil Nature remains in a individual even after God saves him. The poof of this is in
    1 John 1:8. And I’ll just quote that.
    1 John 1:8-Scripture reading:
    8 If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.
    Is that right? (Amen) “If we say that we have not sin, we make him a liar and his word is not in
    us.” Think of that! We do have sin in our life then and that is the sinful Nature!
    1 John 1:10-Scripture quote:
    10 If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.

    54-1203 - The Law Having A Shadow
    William Marrion Branham
    Some time ago…It’s just so easy to condemn and condemn others. Some time ago we was
    having a meeting up here in somewhere in—in, I believe it was Pennsylvania, I believe around
    Erie, or somewhere there. No, it was over in Ohio, Toledo, I believe it was. And we were having
    a great meeting in some arena; thousands were there, and we couldn’t get in and out, and
    hardly. And they keeping me way out in the country in a motel. There was a little place across
    the street there that we were eating at, was a lovely little place, it was Dunkards, you know,
    Amish or Dunkards, whatever they are. And the little ladies that worked in there were such
    clean, nice-acting little ladies. And we were having a wonderful time just eating there and had
    such a dandy time. Well, come Sunday they all closed up and went to church. So that’s the thing
    to do. 46 Well, I was left out there. And Mr. Baxter, the manager, some of them going on in to
    speak. And so Billy, and them, had gone in to give out prayer cards. And I was there. And I
    thought, “Well, I’m just a bit hungry. I haven’t eaten now for two days. I believe I’ll just go get a
    
    11
    sandwich, because I’m going to speak this afternoon.” It was on Sunday. And usually on Sunday
    afternoons I usually tell the life story, or speak to them. Then I thought, “Well, I’ll find…” I
    looked across there, and I said, “That’s a place that’s a restaurant.” Just an ordinary place, and
    I walked across there, and this is shocking. 47 Brother, when as soon as I walked in the door,
    there was a policeman standing there with his arm around a woman, playing a slot machine.
    Gambling’s illegal in Ohio. And there was the law that’s suppose to uphold righteousness
    gambling himself. And he was a man as old as I am. So he must’ve been married and had a wife
    somewhere else. What a disgrace. I looked back there, and there was a young lady at the table
    waiting on some boys, and they was all drunk. And the way that young lady was acting, letting
    them boys act to her, it was a disgrace. And I thought, “Looky there, if it isn’t from—from
    paradise into a rat den, almost.” 48 Listen, let me tell you. Don’t you worry about Russia
    coming over here and whipping the United States. Don’t you worry about some nation coming
    over here to whip on us. We’re whipping ourselves. All morals is breaking down. Yes, it isn’t the
    robin that pecks on the apple that hurts it; it’s the worm at the core that kills the apples. That’s
    what gets the apple. So it isn’t some other nation; it’s our own self. Communism is not Russia.
    Communism is a spirit. That’s right. And it’s sweeping this place and honeycombing it. You
    know that to be true. All right. May have more to say about that some other time. 49 But notice,
    this woman when she was setting over there at that table, that young woman, I thought, “Oh,
    my.” And I looked over here and seen an old fellow setting there, and there set two fellows
    drunk, one with a great big long army overcoat on, and a dear old mother setting there, old
    enough to be my grandmother. And the clothes that the woman had on, little bitty short clothes,
    and her poor old wrinkled arms and flesh. And she had on this here manicure, ever what you call
    it on her lips, you know. With that…I know that’s not the right stuff. I can’t, ever what it is; it’s
    paint. And she had it all over her—her lips like this and it was blue—was blue-looking, you
    know. And she had it…And I looked at the poor old thing; she was setting there with a cigarette,
    smoking it. 50 And I looked, and I thought, “Oh, my.” And two old men…I said, “God, why
    don’t You just strike this thing off, and just wipe it off the map? If me, a sinner, could look, and
    just, and despise such as that, how can Your great holiness look at such a thing as that and stand
    it?” I thought, “O God, my little Rebekah and Sarah are going to have to come up here, one
    eight, and the other one three.” I thought, “How they going to come up here and see such as
    that? What will it be in their day? God, why don’t You just clean the thing up?” And then God
    taught me a lesson. That’s right. You know…The two men got up and went to the rest room. And
    I was standing there looking around. And I thought, “O God, looky here. What is it?” Nobody
    yet waited on me; I was just standing at the door looking around, kind of dark back towards the
    door. 51 And the Holy Spirit said to me, “Come over here.” And I went over, and as I set down, I
    looked. And I saw like the world, and it was revolving around. And around this world was a
    rainbow, looked like a—a streak of red, like a rainbow going around and around the world.
    Then I went right into that, and when I was standing there in that, I looked and I seen Somebody
    standing just above it with His arms out like this. It was our Lord. And I noticed myself, and
    every time I’d go do something wrong, just then according to grace, according to the Word,
    the Father would have took my life right there. But Christ…Every time I would do a sin, then
    it would [Brother Branham hits the pulpit—Ed.] it would hit Him like that. He’d shake His
    head like that. In other words His Blood was acting like a bumper on the automobile. It was
    protecting me from death. And I thought, “Oh, I see.” And I—I seen It come again and there
    was an old Book laying out there, my name written at the top. And it was a sinner’s book smutted
    up. And my name was at the top. And I’d sin; it’d be recorded against me; God would’ve took my
    
    12
    life. But the Blood of Christ protected me. Every time It would hit, I’d see It like that. And I’d see
    those scars on His face from them thorns, and the Blood run down His…bat His weary eyes.
    He’d look back at me, say, “Father, forgive him.” And then, I’d go along I’d do something else,
    and there it would come again like that. He’d say, “Father, forgive him.” 52 I thought, “Oh, I
    see.” If that’s the reason God can’t take the life of those people, sinners, because they are yet
    protected. They have a chance yet. The Blood of Jesus is still protecting them. It’s like a
    bumper to the world. I said, “Oh, I see. I see, Lord, what You mean.” Yeah, the Blood of Jesus
    Christ covered the world like this, and every man while you’re here, you’re still a moral, free
    moral agent. If you reject it, and reject it, and then you die, and your soul goes beyond that, then
    you’ve judged yourself; God don’t have to judge you. See? If you die without the Blood of Christ,
    you’re a sinner and you’re lost. If you accept the Blood, then you’re in Christ, protected. 53 And
    then I seen Him as my sins kept beating Him. I got so brokenhearted I come crawling up to
    Him. I laid down like this; I said, “Lord, look at my name up there.” I said, “Is that my name?”
    He said, “Yes, that’s your name.” I said, “God forgive me. I didn’t mean to make You suffer
    like that. I—I didn’t know my sins were hurting You so bad like that. When I did things, You
    protected me with Your Own Life. Please forgive me?” He took His hand in His side, like that,
    and wrote across there, “Pardoned,” and put it back behind Him like that to remember it no
    more. And He looked down at me. He said, “NOW, I FORGIVE YOU, BUT YOU WANT TO
    CONDEMN HER.” 54 Then that made things different. I come out of the vision. I looked over
    there that poor old woman setting there, toddling, trying to smoke this cigarette and couldn’t
    even get it to her mouth, toddling like that. I said, “Lord God, please forgive me. I’ll not be
    critical any more.” I walked over to where she was, and I said, “How do you do?” She looked
    up and she said, “Oh, how do you do?” And I said, “Could I set down a minute?” She said,
    “You may.” And I—I set down and looked at her. I thought, “Somebody’s mother, no doubt.” I
    thought, “Something’s behind that life; I don’t know what it is.” And I said, “Lady, excuse…” 55
    Said, “You want a smoke?” And I said, “No, ma’am; thank you.” She said, “Would you have a
    drink?” And I said, “No, ma’am; thank you.” I said, “I am a minister of the Gospel of the Lord
    Jesus Christ.” And I said, “I was standing there and condemning you, and asking God why He
    didn’t take your life.” And I told her what had just happened, right there. She said, “Oh, I know
    who you are.” Said, “You’re that preacher down there.” I said, “That’s right.” And I said,
    “What’s behind life?” And that poor old thing begin to tell me of how she’d been mistreated or
    run out like that, how she’d belonged to church one time, and had went astray. I said, “Have you
    got children?” Said, “I got two daughters, married. Both of them are Christians.” And I said,
    “And you setting out here, aren’t you kinda ashamed of yourself?” She said, “I am, sir.” And I
    said, “Don’t you want to accept Christ?” 56 I begin to talk to her, and took her by her poor old
    feeble hands, and the tears running down. She throwed that cigarette on the floor, and knelt
    down there, and humbly come to the Lord Jesus Christ. What a difference when you look at
    yourself one time. Who are we? Where’d we come from? There she got up wiping the tears from
    her eyes. She said, “I’m ashamed of myself, sir.” I said, “Now, mother, go put on your clothes;
    go to church. Get some good church, and—and affil-…get yourself affiliated with it, and be a
    loyal member of Christ’s Body.” I said, “For this day there’s hundreds setting yonder wanted
    to come into a prayer line or so forth, and here the Holy Spirit deals with me, to you, and me
    standing here criticizing you. And God, as me, as a minister let me know, that where am I?”
    Who’d I…Who am I? Where’d I come from? What about me? I may not have done that; I may
    not have done them kind of immoral things, but I’m still a sinner in the sight of God, and the
    
    13
    Blood of Jesus Christ had to protect me. And I accepted it, and she accepted it.
    
     Now, God in salvation breaks the power of this sinful Nature…sinful Nature. God in
    salvation by the power of the Holy Spirit severs that Evil Nature, cuts it in two. Just like you’d
    take a meat cleaver and cut a chicken leg into. Is that right? (Amen)
     But he leaves that Evil Nature in you disconnected as a disciplinary measure that you might
    grow in grace unto the Stature of a perfect man. Is that right? (Amen) When the believer says no
    to this Evil Nature, he defeats Satan and glorifies the Lord Jesus Christ by overcoming that Evil
    Nature. God does not use anybody like a machine, nah he gives you a free will power and you
    are able to choose between good and bad.
     Now, in Romans 6:1 now we’re going to start a tremendous chapter. Now the verse 1. Paul
    said, “What shall we say then?” He asked a question, “Shall we continue in sin, that grace may
    abound?” Two questions. Now these two questions never occurred to Paul, because Paul had a
    revelation of the Grace of God.
    Romans 6:1-2-Scripture reading:
    1 What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?
     There Undoubtedly, there was a Jewish brother a Jewish man or a brother who was living
    under the Law of Moses, ask Paul this question. And it had never occurred to Paul because he
    had a revelation of the grace of God. Is that true? (Amen) He was asked these questions by
    another person who believed in Law. And this person asked said a… well he said something like
    this. “Well, Paul if that’s the case then this amazing grace you preach, well I’ll go ahead and
    except that grace and go ahead and live a life of a occasional planned sin.”
     So, this was the reason of Paul speaking in verse two. Paul said, “God forbid he said Sir,” said
    how shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?”
    Romans 6:2-Scripture reading:
    2 God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?
    Endnote:
    Greek New Testament (6 :2) Paul now proceeds to deal with this question . ... He says that it is
    a mechanical impossibility for a Christian to habitually sustain the same ...
     Paul said, “Sir! It is a mechanical impossibility for the real true believer sustain the same
    relationship habitually to the evil nature which he’s the same before he was saved. BECAUSE
    GOD BY THE POWER OF THE HOLY SPIRIT had severed that Evil Nature. Is that right?

    64-0719M - The Feast Of The Trumpets
    William Marrion Branham
    184 You say, “The Church has to go through the persecution, for the—for the perfection of It.”
    The Blood of Jesus Christ perfects the Bride. 185 A man who chooses a wife don’t put her
    
    14
    through a lot of punishment; he’s already found grace, too, with her; she has found grace with
    him. He—he engages to her. And, if there is anything, he’ll keep her from every place to turn her
    hand. HIS GRACE IS SO GREAT UPON THEM. 186 AND SO WILL IT BE UPON THE
    BRIDE, AND SO IS IT ON THE BRIDE. WE UNWORTHY CREATURES, DESERVING
    OF HELL, BUT HIS GRACE HOLDS US THROUGH IT.
     In answer two, Paul shows by answering this question of this man who was under the law.
    Paul by showing that the believing sinner has changed masters, before salvation having Satan as
    his master. Is that right? (Amen) And since grace has brought inward work in this believer,
    having Jesus has his master. “Mechanical impossibility,” Paul said.
     The key word to understanding Romans 6, is the key word ‘Sin’ of verse 1. Look at that word
    ‘Sin’ in verse 1.
    Romans 6:1-Refering to scripture:
    1 What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?
    The same word ‘Sin’, we want to look at in Romans 5:21, just up from there.
    Romans 5:21- Scripture Reading:
    21 That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto
    eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.
     Here Paul is showing, that Satan reigned as king in your life, over your Evil Nature. BUT
    AFTER JESUS CHRIST CAME INTO YOUR HEART, HE BY THE POWER OF GOD
    BROKE THAT SINFUL NATURE! And now he’s King reigning over your house. You’re not
    gonna have to stay with that old Evil Nature any longer. Because you have King Jesus come
    sitting upon your throne.
     Paul said, “My you poor decrypted friend,” he said, “You don’t understand the Grace I see!”
    Yes! Paul speaks of this gentle nature before you were saved as reigning king, supreme Monarch
    and Satan made you an abject servile slave to do his wickedness. Is that right? (Amen)
     Paul said, “What shall we say then,” he said. Is that right? (Amen) He is referring back now to
    Romans 5:21, speaking of this sinful Nature. But he said, “Where sin abounded” he said through
    Satan reign as king over your heart and through the Evil Nature, GRACE IN SUPER abundance
    did much more abound and fell on top of that, after Jesus has come into your heart to reign as
    Savior of your life.
    Romans 6:1-Reference quote:
    1 What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?
    Romans 5:21-Reference quote:
    21 That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto
    eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.
     This man went on to say and said…. Apostle Paul, he said, “You mean, God is willing to
    forgive sin as fast as I commit it?” Paul said, “If this is the case then, shall we who profess to be
    
    15
    true genuine believers continue to sustain the same relationship to the Evil Nature which we had
    before we were saved,” Paul said. “To allow acts of sin to enter into our experience, just to allow
    God by his love and grace to forgive those sins. Just to prove that God is a God of love and
    grace.”
     You know, there’s a doctrine like that in the world today. Yes, that’s world reconciliation,
    that God is such a God of love and grace, that he wouldn’t think of putting anybody in hell. He
    wouldn’t think of it! And God is so great that he’ll just let me pick out any good-looking girl I
    want.
     “My!” Paul said! “MY DECREPIT FRIEND, MY POOR SICK FRIEND!” He said. “How
    could a person, who has Jesus Christ reigneth upon his throne, ever think a thought like that?”
    Seeing that power of the Evil Nature was severed in to by the Power of The Holy Spirit! He has a
    new master on his throne Jesus!” Is that right? (Amen) Paul said, “God forbid, get away with
    such a thought!”
     Second answer said, “How is it possible for a believer who has once and for all has been
    separated by the power of the sinful nature to live any longer in his grip?” Jesus said, “I HAVE
    THEM IN MY HAND AND NO MAN, NO SIN, NO DEVIL is able to take them out of my
    hand!” I have a grip on them! Once you was helt in the vile grip of Satan. But now the precious
    Lord Jesus has you in his grip and there’s no power, no man able to take you out of my Fathers
    hand. Glory to God! Is that right? (Amen)
    John 10:28-29-Scripture Reference:
    28 And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck
    them out of my hand.
    29 My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of
    my Father's hand.
     Pau speaks of a Christian being dead to sin and are alive unto Jesus Christ! This death that
    Paul is speaking of here in Roman’s is not extinction from life. But it means separation from the
    life that he once lived and now it’s a new creation in Christ Jesus. Is that right? Right? (Amen)

    64-0208 - The Token
    William Marrion Branham
    116 And when we can display the Token of the Holy Spirit, shows that we have been accepted
    in Christ, and that is our Token that all that we have need of is already purchased by Him. We
    are identified with our Token. The Token must be ready. 117 The Blood, Covenant Blood, is not
    recognized without the Token. The Word assures us of the promise. The Token is the sign the
    purchase has been made for us. 118 FULL OBEDIENCE TO THE FULL WORD OF GOD
    ENTITLES US TO THE TOKEN. NO OTHER WAY IS THERE, THAT YOU COULD EVER
    BE ENTITLED TO THE TOKEN, UNTIL YOU FULLY OBEY THE WORD. Not what
    somebody has put into It, and added to It; but what God said about It! 119 When He said, “You
    must be born again.” That don’t mean jump up-and-down at the altar; that don’t mean walk
    back there and shake hands with the pastor; that don’t mean all this foolishness that we’ve seen
    done; it don’t mean putting your name on a church book. IT MEANS DEATH TO YOUR
    FIRST BEING, AND LIFE TO THE SECOND BEING. IT MEANS THAT THE BLOOD
    HAS BEEN APPLIED, AND YOU’RE IDENTIFIED BY THE LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.
    
    16
    And if He be the Vine, and we be the branches, the Life that’s in the branch is in also from the
    Vine. It’ll bear the fruit. 120 If that first branch come forth, that branch out of that Vine, that
    wrote a book of Acts behind it; IF THAT BRANCH EVER PUTS FORTH, A VINE PUTS
    FORTH ANOTHER BRANCH, THEY’LL WRITE ANOTHER BOOK OF ACTS BEHIND
    IT, ’CAUSE IT’S THE SAME LIFE. If a one of your grapevines out here brings forth blue
    grapes, if it puts forth another branch, it’ll bring forth blue grapes. 121 And I tell you, today, we
    got so many grafted vines into It, with denominations and creeds and things, and yet any citrus
    fruit grafted in can live, live in that Vine. But it’s bearing the wrong fruit. 122 WHAT WE
    NEED, TODAY, IS ANOTHER BAPTISM OF THE HOLY SPIRIT, AND HAVE THE REAL
    POWER OF GOD THAT IDENTIFIES THE WORKS THAT JESUS CHRIST PROMISED
    FOR THIS DAY, not so much as that day. This day, the promise that He made here. That was
    what He promised there, He would pour out His Spirit. Now He has promised it again in the
    last days, and what He would do.
    
     Oh, I feel this, this is so good! The Christian has died to sin in the since that God and grace,
    while leaving this sinful nature in the believer has separated him from it. There has been a
    definite cleavage, a disengagement of the person from that Evil Nature. You are completely
    Disengaged from the grip of Satan, completely severed from that power of that Evil Nature.
     I want you to say with me this morning with a shout, “I am severed from the power of the
    Evil Nature!” (I am severed from the power of Evil Nature!) “Satan has no more dominion over
    me!” (Satan has no more dominion over me!) Amen! (Congregation Praise)
     The Evil Nature is a dethroned monarch, because Jesus Christ come and died and rose up
    from among the dead and dethroned Satan upon my heart. He sat down his own self on the
    throne of my heart. Aw, you talking about power! My God you talking about power! It took
    power to break that Evil Nature! Amen!
     When the believer begins to see this truth, he hath eyes to isolate that evil germ nature and
    now he’s getting ready to get a medicine that’ll kill it. Is that right? (Amen) Identified it in its
    proper place.
     By God’s grace we have the remedy for it at hand, and that’s the word of God and the power
    of God. Is that right? (Amen) It is the unknown and unseen enemy, which we so desperately fight
    against and don’t know how to fight. But the Christian who has…has not isolated this Evil
    Nature is fighting…As Paul said, “I don’t fight as one that beateth the air without an opponent.”
    He said, “I have struggle, I have constrained myself, I bring this Evil Nature in subjection to me.
    I bring it down and make it say no!” Is that right? (Amen)

     Now I know, that speaking of judging one another, let me tell you something! If you’d of been
    back when Paul first got saved, you’d of been saved for some time you would of never thought
    he was a servant of God, because he was a sinner. Did all kinds of things he shouldn’t do. Well,
    you say, “Brother Lambert, you got a scripture for that?” Yes, sir!” Paul was ignorant of this
    revelation of his Evil Nature. Is that right? (Amen) He didn’t know that Evil Nature was a
    dethroned monarch in his life. Is that right? (Amen) But he got a revelation in Romans 7:14.
    Read it for me Anthony. Paul got a revelation in Romans 7:14. (Bro. Anthony reads scripture)
    “Sold under sin.” Paul said, “I’m sold under sin, friend.” Paul knew that he was saved, but he did
    not understand this Christian experience.
    Romans 7:14-Scripture Reading:
    14 For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.
     It’s like it was said, and you all know the story of two dogs. The man that spoke about the
    Indian up in Canada. The missionary said, “Where have you been Brother Brown?” He said,
    “Oh, back so and so.” He said, “Well how you doing in your Christian experience?” He said,
    “Oh, great fight going on inside, oh it’s just a struggle every day and every night.” He said,
    “What is the trouble?” He said, “That I have to dogs down in there and they’re fighting
    spiritually continually, a ferocious battle.” And the preacher laughed and the missionary, Said,
    “My goodness!” he said, “Who’s winning?” He said, “Hmmm, the one I feed the most!”
     And that was Paul’s…Paul’s problem. Paul didn’t understand it, the Christian experience. He
    said, “The very thing that I wish to do namely good, I can’t do it.” Is that what he said? (Amen)
    He said, “The very thing that I don’t want to do, that’s what I do, namely sin.”
    Romans 7:15-17-Reference quote:
    15 For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.
    16 If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that it is good.
    17 Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.
     MY! WHO SHALL DELIVER ME FROM THIS POWER OF THIS EVIL NATURE? Jesus
    Christ my Lord! Aw, the power of God! Jesus Christ my Savior shall deliver Bob Lambert!
     Getting to know each better this morning, aren’t we? (Amen) I’m glad to greet you sinners
    here this morning! (Congregation laughs and praises God)
     Yes, Paul was struggling in his own self, but one day he prayed through. He said, “Paul, My
    Grace is sufficient for thee, for My strength is made perfect in this weakness of the Evil Nature.”
    2 Corinthians 12:9-Reference quote:
    9 And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in
    weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ
    may rest upon me.
    
    18
    Because Paul, “You’re going to have to stay on your knee’s praying, you’re going to have to
    bridle your tongue Paul, you’re going to have to overcome this Evil Nature! And the only way
    that you can do it Paul, is by Me!”
     I want to say to you this morning, your only the hope is through the Lord Jesus Christ. If
    you’re resting in your hope how holy you are, if you’re resting on your hope of giving yourself
    to the Lord Jesus Christ because you don’t have a wife. If you young virgins are counting on the
    fact of overcoming this Evil Nature by the fact that you’re going to remain unmarried. You’ll
    never make it! Only through Jesus Christ our Lord! If some of you are gonna overcome this Evil
    Nature just fasting, you’ll never make it! THROUGH JESUS CHRIST THE FINISHED
    WORKS AT THE CROSS OF CALVERY!
     Satan is a dethroned monarch in my life! Through His death and His resurrection. By
    identifying myself with Him, thereby able to be a partaker of his Devine Nature! Is that true?
    (Amen)
     This great truth of Romans 6 this morning, should enable you and I in this local Christian
    Assembly or visiting friends, to gain a constant victory over this trouble that we so…are so full
    of the Evil Nature. It should do it, it will do it, it is gonna do it. Is that right? (Amen) Let each
    one of us form a habit of saying no, too this Evil Nature. Is that right? (Amen)
     Now let’s look in Verse 4 of Romans. “Therefore, we are buried with him by baptism” I’m
    not gonna read…I’m take that word Baptism. This is not…I hope I don’t get in…but if I’d be
    wrong…it’s not a great doctrine that would upset anybody. But most of us think of water
    baptism. When we think of this Baptism.
    Romans 6:4-Scripture Reading:
    4 Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from
    the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.
    But I would like to speak on it as the Baptism of the spirit. Because I don’t believe water
    Baptism in water will sever you from any Evil Nature. It takes the Holy Spirit to do that. (Amen)
    But I want to speak on this word Baptism. A now going back to this coal tail now. First God to
    break that Evil Nature, He gives you Justification by Faith. Then He gives you Sanctification,
    which is set you apart to receive this other work of grace which is the Baptism of the Holy Spirit.
    Is that right? (Amen) Now God through sanctification has severed you from that Evil Nature.
    And you don’t have to obey its lusts any longer, you have something from God to say no to it. Is
    that right? (Amen)
     This…Now this Baptism here in Verse 4. Now after you are justified by believing on the Lord
    Jesus, Christ God answers your Faith of justification and you move into sanctification. Is that
    right? (Amen) By hearing the word of God. And then you are waiting upon the promise of the indwelling Christ and God finishes up so to speak, his deterrent against this Evil Nature. And that
    he Baptizes that believer with the Baptism of the Holy Ghost. Jesus Christ then comes and sets
    upon your throne of your heart, of your soul, reigning as supreme monarch of your life. Then
    your will is no more my will, I will or I will do it, but thy will be done Lord. Thy will be done
    Lord! His desire is your desire, His life is your life and because you have that Divine Nature,
    because He lives, I live. And because He’ll never die, I’ll never die, because He’s resurrected,
    I’ll resurrect from the grave. Hallelujah!

    confirm his faith. And when a man believes on the Lord Jesus Christ, GOD GIVES HIM THE
    BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST TO SEAL THAT HE HAS RECOGNIZED HIS
    RIGHTEOUS FAITH AND GIVE HIM THE SEAL OF THE HOLY GHOST. For the Bible
    said in Ephesians 4:30, ‘Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of

    up to His right hand, and sent the Holy Spirit back. The covenant with the people! And you
    believe, by faith, like Abraham did, and he was given the seal of circumcision for a confirmation
    of his faith. And you believe and accept Jesus as your Saviour, then God gives you the baptism
    of the Holy Ghost as a confirmation of your faith. 36 You say you “believe, and haven’t
    received the Holy Spirit”? Something wrong with your faith. God circumcises the heart the
    minute the believer really comes in full surrendering. Amen. Say, That, well, surely must have
    done something, I felt that even come back. Get it! When the believer…Here it is now! When the
    believer firmly believes on the Lord Jesus Christ, God’s under obligation to give him the Holy
    Ghost. Confirmation of his faith! Say, “What’s the matter, Brother Branham?” Just your faith,
    that’s all. If you truly believe, God’s there to give It to you. 37 “While Peter spake these Words,
    the Holy Ghost fell on them that heard the Word.” Is that right? Acts 10:49. ALL RIGHT,

    5 We believe in “justification by faith,” Romans 5:1. We believe that, after a person being
    justified by faith, he has peace with the Lord Jesus Christ. But it’s possible that this same
    person could have habits such as drinking, smoking, doing things that he should not do, filthy
    habits of the flesh. 6 Then we believe that the Blood of Jesus Christ sanctifies this person for the
    service of the Lord. And that’s, we believe in “sanctification” according to Hebrews 13:12 and
    13, “Where Jesus also, that He might sanctify the people with His Own Blood, suffered without
    the gates.” And we believe that sanctification is taught in the New Testament, and meant for the
    believers through the New Testament age, which we are now living. 7 And we also believe that
    after the person has been sanctified, the unclean habits has gone from the person, he is a
    believer on the Lord Jesus Christ, and his habits are gone: WE BELIEVE THAT THEN HE
    IS A CANDIDATE FOR “THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY SPIRIT,” WHICH COMES AS A
    FILLING OF THE BELIEVER. And then when the believer… 8 It’s just, as many times as I
    have taught it, like picking up a glass out in the chicken yard. Justification is “picking it up,
    ready to use it,” with a purpose in heart. That’s what God does to the sinner. He is still filthy. 9
    Then he is cleansed by the Blood of Jesus Christ. And the word sanctify is a compound word,
    which means, “cleaned, and set aside for service.” In the Old Testament, the altar sanctified the
    vessel, and it was set aside for service. 10 We believe that the Holy Spirit is putting the same
    vessel in service. That the Holy Spirit is not another step of grace, but more of the same grace
    that fills the believer to the extent where that signs and wonders, such as the apostolic gifts
    spoken of in First Corinthians 12, manifest themselves through this believer when the Holy
    Spirit comes in to take up the gift.

     This new nature of the Spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ gives us the indwelling nature, the
    indwelling power to do the works of Christ. It severs us from the old Nature and all our will is
    swallowed up in this sweet will of the Lord Jesus.
     Didn’t the prophet the Bride should be saying, “Not my will but thine be done.” Well, that

    it through you. He makes intercession according to His will. It’s His heart, it’s His throne!

    Pergamean Church Age- An Exposition Of The Seven Church Ages - 5 - The
    William Marrion Branham
    Whatever seed started the church will come forth and be like the original seed because it is the
    same seed. IN THESE LAST DAYS THE TRUE BRIDE CHURCH (CHRIST’S SEED) WILL
    COME TO THE HEADSTONE, AND SHE WILL BE THE SUPER CHURCH, A SUPER
    RACE, AS SHE NEARS HIM. THEY IN THE BRIDE WILL BE SO MUCH LIKE HIM
    THAT THEY WILL EVEN BE IN HIS VERY IMAGE. This is in order to be united with Him.
    They will be one. They will be the very manifestation of the Word of the living God.
    Denominations cannot produce this (wrong seed). They will produce their creeds and their
    dogmas, mixed with the Word. This mongrelizing brings forth a hybrid product. The first son
    (Adam) was the spoken seed-Word of God. He was given a bride to reproduce himself. That is
    why the bride was given to him, to reproduce himself; to produce another son of God. But she
    fell. She fell by hybridization. She caused him to die. The second Son (Jesus), also a spoken
    Seed-Word of God was given a bride like as was Adam. But before He could marry her, she also
    had fallen. She, like Adam’s wife, was put to the test whether she would believe the Word of God
    and live, or doubt the Word and die. She doubted. She left the Word. She died. From a little
    group of the true seed of the Word, God will present Christ with a beloved bride. She is a
    virgin of His Word. She is a virgin because she knows no man-made creeds or dogmas. By and
    through the members of the bride will be fulfilled all that was promised of God to be made
    manifest in the virgin. The word of promise came to the virgin Mary. But that Word of
    promise was He, Himself, to be made manifest. God was made manifest. He, Himself, acted at
    that time and fulfilled His own Word of promise in the virgin. It was an angel that had
    brought her the message. But the angel’s message was the Word of God. Isaiah 9:6. He
    fulfilled at that time all that was written of Him because she accepted His Word to her. The
    members of the virgin bride will love Him, and they will have His potentials, for He is their
    head, and all power belongs to Him. They are subject to Him as the members of our bodies are
    subject to our heads. Notice the harmony of the Father and the Son. Jesus never did anything
    until it was first showed Him by the Father. John 5:19. This harmony is now to exist between
    the Groom and His bride. He shows her His Word of life. She receives it. She never doubts it.
    
    22
    Therefore, nothing can harm her, not even death. For if the seed be planted, the water will
    raise it up again. Here is the secret of this. The Word is in the bride (as it was in Mary). The
    bride has the mind of Christ for she knows what He wants done with the Word. She performs
    the command of the Word in His name for she has “thus saith the Lord.” Then the Word is
    quickened by the Spirit and it comes to pass. Like a seed that is planted and watered, it comes
    to full harvest, serving its purpose. THOSE IN THE BRIDE DO ONLY HIS WILL. No one
    can make them do otherwise. They have “thus saith the Lord” or they keep still. They know that
    it has to be God in them doing the works, fulfilling His own Word. HE DID NOT COMPLETE
    ALL HIS WORK WHILE IN HIS EARTHLY MINISTRY SO NOW HE WORKS IN AND
    THROUGH THE BRIDE. She knows that, for it was not yet time for Him to do certain things
    that He must now do. BUT HE WILL NOW FULFILL THROUGH THE BRIDE THAT
    WORK WHICH HE LEFT FOR THIS SPECIFIC TIME.

    was under a strain. The sins of the world was upon Him. And then He looked into the face of the
    Dove, and said, “Not My will, but Thy will be done.” 132 Oh, can we have that decision in our
    hearts this morning? Can you forfeit that little, filthy life of yours? Are you willing to look into
    His face and say, “Not my will”? “I’m a drunkard, but I’ll drink no more. I’m a gambler; I’ll
    drink no more. I’m immoral, but I’ll be that way no more. I’m a liar, but I’ll stop it today. I’m
    a foul person. But in this conference, this morning, I’ll look into Your face, and take, like my
    Master Who died for me, to make my way clear, ‘Not my will; Your will.’ If it cost me my home.
    If it cost me my husband, my wife, my father, my mother, my fellowship, my church
    membership, whatever it cost me. In this conference, this morning, I say I want Your Holy
    Spirit to live in me. I’ve heard about It. I want You in me. Not mine, but Yours. That’s my
    decision.” God has called the place, not upon some high, pinnacle place, but a humble little
    tabernacle about to fall in. We’re having a conference.
     YOU WERE BOUGHT WITH A PRICE! Is that right? (Amen) Paul gives us this precious
    truth again in Philippians 2: 12 and 13. Said, “12 Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always
    obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence” To carry out its
    Ultimate conclusion, “your salvation with fear and trembling.”
    Philippians 2:12-13-Scripture Reading:
    12 Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much
    more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.

    246 For I know this, that there is Someone There waiting for me. THERE IS SOMEONE PAID
    THE PRICE THAT I COULDN’T PAY. THAT’S RIGHT. He did it for me, Charlie. Did it for
    you. He did it for the whole human race. And now He comes forth to claim His redemptive
    rights. Claim it for who? Not for Himself; for us. He is one of us. He is our kinfolks. Oh, my!
    He is my Brother. He is my Saviour. He is my God. HE IS MY KINSMAN REDEEMER. He is
    all. For what was I without Him, or what could I be without Him? So, see, He is my All. And He
    is standing There as our kinfolks. And now He’s been interceding for us, up till this time. And
    now He comes forth and takes the Book of Redemption, to claim His rights, of what He did for
    us. 247 They die. Jesus said, “He that believeth on Me, though he were dead, yet shall he live.
    Whosoever liveth and believeth on Me shall never die. He that eats My flesh and drinks My
    Blood has everlasting Life, and I’ll raise him up at the last day.” 248 No matter, he falls asleep
    in the first watch, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, or seventh, wherever he falls asleep. What’ll
    happen? The trumpet of God shall sound. That last trump will blast forth, the same time that
    the last angel is giving his Message and the last Seal is opened. That last trumpet will sound,
    and the Redeemer comes forth to take His redeemed possessions, His Church, Blood-washed.
    249 Now, oh, the whole creation lays in His hand now, on which the whole plan of redemption
    is sealed by seven mysterious Seals, in this Book that He took. Now watch. “AND HE ALONE
    CAN REVEAL IT TO WHOMSOEVER HE WILL.” He’s got It in His hand, see. Now, He
    promised it would be at that time, now, for It is sealed by Seven Seals of mystery, the Book of
    Redemption. Now watch. As now… 250 Friends, I told you, going to let you out at eight-thirty,
    but I’ve throwed over three or four pages here, to get to this. So I want…I’m already after nine.
    So that you can get back tomorrow. 251 But now in this sevenfold Book of Seals, of
    redemption, that the Lamb took, within Himself, was the only One Who could do it. And He
    took It from the right hand of Him that sat upon the Throne, now, to claim His redemptive, to
    claim His rights. To claim, for me and you, what He redeemed us from, to, see, back to
    everything that Adam lost in the garden of Eden. He has redeemed us back to that. 252 Now
    with the Lamb, with the Book in His hands, we are ready to ask His grace and mercy upon us,
    to open the Seven-Seal Book to us, and let us look a past the curtain of time, just a little bit.
    Oh, my! Notice when He took the Book, the title deed, sealed, (just get that in your mind now),
    and broke the Seals of the mystery, to reveal them, to bring them to His, see, all of His
    redeemed subjects. 253 Now, when we hit this in the Seals, we’re going to go back there and see
    them souls under the altar, crying, “Lord, how long, how long?” 254 And here He is as a
    Mediator, on the altar, “Just a little longer, until there’s more has to suffer like you.” 255 BUT
    NOW HE COMES FROM HERE, AT THIS LAST SEAL. He no more Mediator. HE IS KING
    NOW. And what does He do? If He’s a King, He has to have subjects. And His subjects is them
    that He has redeemed, and they cannot come before Him until He takes the rights of
    redemption. And now He walks forth, from a Mediator; where death put us in the grave, He
    comes forth with the rights. Amen. 256 “And even those who are alive and remain till His
    Coming, shall not hinder them which are asleep. For the trumpet of God shall sound, at that
    last trumpet.” When the last Seal is broke, and when the seventh angel is giving his Message,
    “The last trumpet shall sound, and the dead in Christ shall rise. And we which are alive and
    remain shall be caught up together with them, to meet Him in the air.” He claims! He has come
    
    24
    forth now to claim His—His possession. 257 Watch! Look at this! My! Broke the Seals, revealed
    the mysteries. Revealed them (where?) to the last church age, the only one that’s living. The
    rest of them is sleeping. 258 He said, “If He comes in the first watch, second watch, third watch,
    on down to the seventh watch.” In the seventh watch, there went out a—a command, or a call,
    “Behold, the Bridegroom cometh!”
     For it is God who is the one who is constantly putting forth energy in you. Did you get that?
    God is the one who is imparting to you both the willingness and the ability to do His Gods will.
    God has given us EVERYTHING to be able to overcome this Evil Nature. He’s given us both
    the will and the strength and the willingness to do it. So, it can be done, it will be done, it shall be
    done.
     Jesus Christ is going to have a perfect Bride. Now, no wonder Paul answered, “My Sir,” He
    said, “It is a mechanical impossibility for him that believes in Jesus Christ and has Salvation to
    Habitually sustain the same relationship to his old Evil Nature. He said, “It is a mechanical
    impossibility and Paul is proving it by mechanics here. Is that right? (Amen) He said, “He no
    more wants to do his will, his will is swallowed in the will of his lovely Savior. Is that right?

    why didn’t you bring Christ, the Bridegroom, to the bride? Going to let that soak, a minute.
    Why? BECAUSE YOU PREGNATED HER, YOURSELF, WITH YOUR DENOMINATION.
    THAT’S EXACTLY WHAT YOU DONE. HE WON’T MARRY A WHORE. He’ll marry a
    virgin. It’s flat, but that’s the Truth. You know It, in a flat way. You don’t have to wonder. I
    don’t stumble around about It. Tell you the Truth. WHY DIDN’T IT BRING HER? WHY
    DIDN’T IT BRING CHRIST, BRING CHRIST TO HER? BECAUSE SHE’S NOT FIT. HE
    FOUND HER IN ADULTERY. 264 Exactly the reason children don’t live forever when
    they’re born; Adam found his wife pregnated. 265 That’s the reason Jehovah had to take a
    Gentile Bride; found her pregnated. 266 That’s exactly the way Christ has to get Him a Bride
    now; He’s found the so-called group pregnated. HE’S GOING TO SOW HIS SEED.
    SOMEBODY IS GOING TO GET IT, BECAUSE THEY’RE PREDESTINATED TO BE A
    CHURCH AT THE END OF THE ROAD. 267 Like Adam and Jehovah’s, He found them
    pregnated with man-made doctrines of denominations. Like God’s Truth, in Genesis 1, “Every
    seed has brought forth after its kind.” So, when the Spirit fell on her, man had been there to
    her womb, and filled it with denominational seeds of his own thinking, so that’s why she got to
    be the way she is, and Christ could not come to her. Hum! That’s hard, isn’t it?
    
     The Lord wants you to pray, the Evil Nature says, “No, go to bed!” The Lord would say,
    “Why don’t you fast a meal!” The Evil Nature saying, “Why you just go ahead and eat and you
    can fast tomorrow.” Oh, he’ll say, “Oh, you know what that brother did? Aw you know, boy that
    guy did so and so.” Evil Nature! When he begins to say, the ole Evil cravings of the ole Evil
    Nature begin to say, “Talk about your brother.” “You’re a dethroned Monarch, I’m severed from
    that ole Evil Nature! By the power of God, I won’t say nothing about my brother or sister.” Is
    that right? (Amen)
     You must form a habit of saying, “No,” to this Evil Nature. Then by forming this good habit,
    you’ll be able to do away with the bad habit of obeying the Evil Nature. Is that right? (Amen)
    Now remember, we don’t have to obey the Evil Nature any longer. Is that right? (Amen)

    3 And I said, “Surely, there is something in this Word of God, from Genesis to Revelation, that
    some character in there that You dealt with, would be on the same basis that would be my
    question. If somebody done something, and—and You got after him about it, then let me turn to
    that place in the Bible. And if somebody, whatever they done, it’ll lean my way. Where I’ve done
    wrong, or something You want me to do, or haven’t done, let me see some character in the Bible
    like that.” 94 And I closed my eyes, just let the Bible fall open, put my finger on a Scripture,
    Genesis 24:7. Eliezer, Abraham’s faithful servant, the model servant of the Bible, being sent to
    
    26
    hunt the bride for Isaac. CHILLS RUN OVER ME. SURE, THAT’S MY…THAT’S RIGHT
    WITH THE REST OF MY MESSAGE, PULLING OUT THE BRIDE. 95 He said, “Sware
    that you’ll not take a bride out of these, but go to my own people.” He said, “What if the woman
    won’t come with me?” 96 Said, “Then you’re free of this oath.” He said, “And the God of
    Heaven will send His Angel before you, to direct you.” He went right straight out and begin
    praying, and he met the beautiful Rebekah that become the bride of Isaac. 97 JUST A
    PERFECT MESSAGE, BACK TO THE WORD, “GO GET THAT BRIDE!” THAT’S A
    DUTY. THAT’S WHAT I’M HERE FOR. THAT’S WHAT I’M TRYING TO DO, IS CALL
    OUT A BRIDE. 98 Remember in California there, that interview of the Bride, preview, I had it
    here. How that Bride come up first, and seen Her go by. Then here come Miss America, Miss
    Asia, and all, oh, the awfulest looking thing! And then the same Bride passed by again. One of
    them got out of step, and I was getting Her back in step; two of them, it was. AND THAT’S
    WHAT I WAS SUPPOSED TO DO, KEEP THAT BRIDE IN STEP, HUNT THAT MAN. 99 I
    said, “God, I’m going back home, renew my vows again, and start out anew.” So that’s what
    we’re planning on doing, THAT’S WHAT I’M HERE FOR.

    28 And where does the fruit ripen at quickly? In top of the tree. Why? The light’s on it. Amen!
    That’s right. And right in the top of the tree, in this last days, He’s bringing forth a Bride Tree.
    429 Now remember, He is that Tree of Life, contrary to “the serpent’s seed,” you see. He’s that
    Seed, “the woman’s Seed,” the Tree of Life in the garden. “And lest they put forth their hands
    and move this Tree, they’d eat that Tree and live forever.” AND HE’S THE ONLY TREE THAT
    CAN BE TAKEN, THAT YOU CAN LIVE FOREVER. HIS WORD IS LIFE. And that be the
    Word then, the Word of God which Eve turned down in the garden of Eden; then HERE IS
    CHRIST, THE WORD, MADE MANIFEST. 430 And when He come on earth, He was the Tree
    of Life. Do you believe that? [Congregation says, “Amen.”—Ed.] And Rome, what did they do?
    He had to be chopped down. And He was put on a tree of disgrace, “cursed is he that hang on a
    tree,” become a curse for the human race. 431 AND NOW THROUGH THAT, HE BRINGS
    FORTH A BRIDE TREE, WHICH WILL BE THE TREE OF LIFE RESTORED BACK TO
    HIM, AS HUSBAND AND WIFE IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN, (OH, GLORY TO GOD) BY
    THE SAME WORD AND THE SAME GOD MADE MANIFEST IN HUSBAND AND WIFE,
    THE SAME BRIDE TREE BACK AGAIN. 432 Notice, making it known! How…My, there’s just
    so much here, we could just keep on going. Notice, this TREE, OF CHRIST’S BODY, IN THE
    GARDEN. MAKING, NOW MAKING HIS MYSTERY KNOWN TO THIS BRIDE TREE. 433
    Watch, REDEEMED BY CHRIST, THE SECOND ADAM. You believe He was? [Congregation
    says, “Amen.”—Ed.] Going back Home, to Eden, with His fallen wife redeemed back Home
    again. That’s Christ in the Church today, taking His Wife back. See the threefold mystery now?
    [“Amen.”] GOD MANIFESTED IN CHRIST; CHRIST MANIFESTED IN THE CHURCH;
    ALL TOGETHER, TO BRING BACK THE ORIGINAL ADAM AND EVE AGAIN, MAN AND
    WOMAN, WHICH ARE ONE, MADE OUT OF THE SAME BLOOD AND SAME SPIRIT,
    AND EVERYTHING ELSE. 434 The Church is the Blood of Christ, by the Spirit, because the—
    the Life is in the Blood. THAT’S THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST THAT BAPTIZES
    
    27
    US INTO HIS BODY, THAT RECOGNIZES ONLY HIS BODY, HIS FLESH, HIS WORD.
    [Brother Branham pats his Bible—Ed.] 435 Denomination won’t, never touch that. IT’S A
    REVELATION. SHE KNOWS IT. So did Eve know it, but she fell; BUT THIS ONE KNOWS
    IT, AND WON’T FALL. SHE IS ORDAINED! HALLELUJAH! WHEW! SHE IS ORDAINED
    TO NOT FALL. SHE WON’T FAIL. SHE IS PREDESTINATED TO IT. “Blessed is the man
    who God will not impute sin.”
     Now, this word Baptize is the English spelling of the Greek word. It is not the translation; it is
    only the spelling. This word baptize means the introducing or placing of a person or thing into a
    new environment or into a union of something else, as to alter its condition or its relationship to
    its previous environment or condition. Did you understand? (Amen) In other words a new
    creation. You’re not an old creation anymore, you’re a new creation. Is that right? (Amen)
     You don’t go to that same ole environment down there in the bars in the night clubs, houses
    with prostitution you were in. Is that right? (Amen) YOU’RE IN A NEW ENVIRONMENT,
    YOU’RE SITTING IN HEAVENLY PLACES IN CHRIST JESUS OUR LORD. With the
    power of the Holy Ghost moving and working among us. Contending for the faith that was once
    delivered to the saints. That’s what that baptism does for you.
     And yes, it’ll speaks in tongues, it’ll prophesy, it’ll do all kinds of things. It’ll reveal the
    secrets of the heart. But if it just reveals the secrets of the heart, and never lives like a lamb, like
    a dove. Remember now, don’t misunderstand me! Yes, a Holy Spirit filled, baptized sealed by
    God Christian will have the outward appearance working of that evil nature.
     But he…Let me tell you something! If you want to look, don’t look for evidence of the Holy
    Ghost, just meet him. And if you ever meet my Jesus, if you ever meet the Lord Jesus Christ that
    I met, you’ll fall madly in love with him. When you realize that he died for you, he bled for you,
    He suffered for you, then you’ll never want to do anything wrong, because you’re in love with
    Jesus and Jesus is in love with you. What a blessed union!
     No wonder Paul said, “Oh foolish man what a question,” he said. “What, we that are dead to
    sin live any longer in sin” he said, “Just to prove the grace of God, oh no my friend.” That’s a
    foolish question. You know, that question is still among the believers today. Is that right? (Amen)
    They was asking one of those questions.
     Now yes, we have these spontaneous outburst of the Evil Nature, but when you have them
    remember, you hurt Jesus, you helt back the body of Christ. You stopped the Bride from moving
    on into higher heights. Remember that, you stopped it, dead in its tracks when you did it. The
    Bride got out of step didn’t it? (Amen) Yeah, that puts one-person, wonderful Bride out of step.
    Is that right? (Amen) Your toe is hooked to my foot, makes me walk very bad, I’m crippled
    enough anyway. (Congregation laughs) The Brides crippled enough without me holding it back
    any longer. I tell ya, I sure want to get right with this Evil Nature.
     Alright now hurriedly now, let’s rush right on through. Now we were on this word Baptism.
    Right? (Amen) We changed relationship into a new environment, we are new creatures in Christ
    Jesus. “Meek as a lamb and harmless as a dove.” Is, that right? (Amen) we don’t have a wolf on
    our shoulder, but we have a dove on our shoulder, it’s a sweet lovely dove. Because we are
    severed from the nature that the wolf likes so well. The wolf didn’t follow the Lord Jesus Christ
    around, the dove did. Now if we have any wolfs following us, let’s kill them. Let’s don’t try to
    eat and devoir one another like hungry wolfs, but let’s love one another like a dove. Is that right?
    (Amen)
    
    28
     Paul had answered…Now I want to speak one more thing on this Baptism. This baptism here
    refers to the act of the Holy Spirit introducing or placing the believer, the believing sinner into a
    vital use, a use with Jesus Christ in answer to his Faith of Justification and Sanctification. This
    union is a answer; sisters to… from God to you that he has recognized your faith in him. When
    he sends this Divine nature into the throne of your heart. Is that right? (Amen)

    STATURE OF A PERFECT MAN
     ¯ Baptism of the Holy Ghost-The Great Sealing- Capstone-Perfect Love-Token
    ¬First FAITH-SEED FROM CHRIST, start here to build a body for
    Christ to dwell in.
     Now Paul has fully answered this question. Right? (Amen) Paul declared that it to be an
    impossibility an impossibility! As the power of the sinful nature is broken and the Devine nature
    imparted to the believer. So that makes it impossible! That’s really security, isn’t it? (Amen)
     Now, let’s move along, I’ve got some notes here that I’ll just bypass. Now as a result of this
    operation of the holy spirit, this believer does not desire, he does not desire to obey that nature
    anymore. Because he only has the desire of the Holy Spirit. How can you do these things? Now
    remember, he will do them in the growing up stage, he will do these things. But when he finds
    and isolates that Evil Nature and is growing up into an adult Christian, his will is swallowed up
    in Gods will! His life is swallowed up in his life and the life he now lives, he lives by power and
    by the word of God! Is that right? (Amen) He has both the power and the desire to say no to that
    Evil Nature. Which before had helt him as a slave in his mighty powerful jaw grip. Is that right?
    (Amen) The believer now has the impelling motive, strength and power to be a real Christian.
     So therefore, it is…remember therefore it is impossible for you if you say that you have the
    Baptism of the Holy Spirit to habitually…that means to make a habit out of it, continually living
    after the desire and the dictate of your Evil Nature. If you do habitually do this, it proves that
    something is wrong with your experience.
     So, with this, this morning looking upon our younger brothers and her sisters in the Lord as
    they toddle along making mistakes and doing the things of the flesh, those that have. By a better
    knowledge of Romans 6 will enable them and help them to overcome this Evil Nature. Not talk
    about them, it proves then there is something wrong WITH YOU! You may have somebody else
    sitting upon the throne of your heart. Could be? True? (Amen) So, it isn’t a mechanical
    impossibility to habitually live in this Evil Nature.
     The Christian is exhorted! Let me give you a short illustration. In a machine…. I’m gonna
    talk real fast now so you can get through. In a machine shop years ago in the 1930s they didn’t
    have power motors to run their Lathe. They had a gigantic wheel in the ceiling and these lathes
    were operated by a belt running up to that wheel. When they wanted the lathes to be in operation,
    they slipped the belt on by a stick, scooted it over there. And then when they wanted to stop the
    
    29
    lathes…Now the lathes represents you and me. When they wanted to stop the lathes, they slipped
    the belt off. God, BY THE POWER OF THE HOLY SPIRIT DISCONNECTED THAT BELT
    FROM YOU, THE POWER OF THE EVIL NATURE. Now, He doesn’t ever connect that
    again, you do it! When you listen to the dictates of your flesh you connect that belt again. GODS
    PERFECT WILL IS TO LEAVE IT DISCONNECTED. And grow in grace in a stature of a
    perfect daughter and son God. Is that right? (Amen)
     Then we will have an apostolic church. We will have an apostolic church when you and I let
    this become real in our lives, A perfect church. You can’t grieve the Holy Spirit away! You can’t
    stop him from coming either, He’ll be there in his power! THEN THE HOLY SPIRIT WILL
    FALL UPON YOU! When you don’t have ought against one another, when your heart is
    cleansed by the power and the word of God. The Holy Spirit will then come in His fullness and
    fall and say, “Thus Saith the Lord, go do this, this and go do that.” And not until!
    Matthew 5:23-24-Reference quote:
    23 Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought
    against thee;
    24 Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and
    then come and offer thy gift.

    61-1210 - Paradox
    William Marrion Branham
    255 I’ve often wanted to come into a church, I’ve longed to see it, I guess, where I could walk
    in the back door, front door, wherever it was, look across an audience and see a perfect
    church, all in order. Sin couldn’t stay there; no, the Spirit call it out, you see. It just couldn’t
    stay. Like Ananias and Sapphira, you—you just couldn’t do it. There’ll be no sin in that—that
    group. No, sir. See, the Spirit quickly speak it like that. [Brother Branham quickly snaps his
    finger four times—Ed.] No matter what it was, how little, it would be done. See women and
    men sitting there under the Power of the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of God moving perfectly,
    moving this. Someone had done something wrong in the congregation, couldn’t, they’d
    be…They couldn’t, it’d…They come quickly, confess it before them. The Spirit got a hold of it,
    to confess it, both. They come, tell it, ’cause they know right then it’s going to be called. That’s
    right. That’s the Church of the living God. How my old, poor old heart, now it’s getting old,
    how I’ve longed to stand and see a church like that. I may, yet. I hope to. Perfect works of God,
    without sin, now, it could understand. 256 Now here stands a group of people to be prayed for.
    Now, we realize, if this Scripture is true…And the God of Heaven, Who could create a squirrel,
    could create a ram, could stop the sun for a whole day, twenty-four hours, that could keep fire
    from burning people in a furnace for three hours, He could stop the mouth of lions, that could
    raise the dead, could walk on water, could take biscuits and feed five thousand, that’s God.
    That’s the Word made flesh in human beings. Now does everybody understand that? Now this
    same God promised that in the last days these things would reoccur again, but He can’t do it
    until there is somebody He can work them with, and work on. You see what I mean? Now let’s
    believe that, emphatically, with all of our heart, that it’s going to be that way.

    59 That’s the way it is with Christ. If I—if I live…I’m fifty, if I live to be ninety or a hundred,
    have another fifty years to preach, and I never preach a time, go down and sit on the river, I’m
    saved anyhow. God saved me by His grace, unmerited of anything I ever could do, did do, or
    anything else. I preach because I love Him and I love His people. And that’s the reason I know
    I’ve passed from death unto Life, because that I love them and I go after them. No matter what
    kind of condition they’re in, I go after them anyhow. Go get them anyhow, pull them anyhow. If
    ministers disagree and others disagree, and denominations disagree, that don’t stop me. There’s
    something! It didn’t stop Him! He come right in the midst of unbelief, and it didn’t stop Him, He
    moved right on anyhow. That’s what we do, go out and get them, catch them anyhow. No matter,
    reach, grab, hold on with all your might. You don’t know who they are. Save them. That’s
    because of love. Not because that “I have to,” but because I love, because you love. 60 Say, “I
    ought to go make that right with that woman, but, I tell you right now, I guess ’cause I go to
    church I ought to go make it right.” No, you’re the one ought to get right, first. See? See? If you
    ain’t got the love of God in your heart, something another makes you know that you’re wrong,
    then you go—then you go make it right with God. Then you’ll make it right with your neighbor.
    61 Jesus taught the same thing. He said, “If you come to an altar, and there’s a…remember

    now the power of Almighty God is formed in the church, coming forth. Hallelujah! I’m looking
    for when God is going to shake the whole thing, everywhere. Brother, it’s already in session
    right now. It’s going on. That’s right. 79 The Deity of Him. Who is He? Some of them makes Him
    a little baby back there. He is the One that stood on the invisible, oh, my, platform, raked out His
    hands, and spoke and said, “Let there be light,” and there was light. That was Jesus Christ.
    “For He was in the world, and the world was made by Him, and the world recognized Him
    not.” He was…He is the Deity of God. Look what He did back there. Talk about the miraculous
    back there; you talk about shouting? When He performed the miraculous things, to make things
    which are now, out of things which was not, He spoke and it was so. 80 And that same Power,
    
    31
    that same Christ! Hallelujah! Let the fundamentalists, let them people who deny the Power of
    God, say It’s wrong, but that same Power that spoke the world into existence is in those people
    that’s got the Holy Ghost. That’s right. Men and women, it’s time that we found out who you
    are. The devil is trying to hide you back, tell you that you’re some little cowed-down
    something. You’re not. YOU ARE SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD. THE DEITY IS NOT
    IN HEAVEN; IT’S IN YOU. Hallelujah! I know you think I’m crazy, but let me tell you
    something, brother. [Brother Branham knocks on the pulpit three times—Ed.] WHEN YOU
    REALIZE THAT ALMIGHTY GOD LIVES IN YOU; IMMORTAL LIFE, “MY LIFE I
    GIVE, ZOE.” THE LIFE OF GOD IS IN THE HUMAN BEING. 81 He stood back there,
    He’s the Creator of all things. He made life; frogs, oh, bees, ducks, chickens, animals, created
    everything. “And nothing was made but what was made by Him.” Who? Christ, the Deity! “He
    brought down plagues, and everything in the days of Egypt.” Who? Christ! “He stopped the—the
    mouths of lion. He quenched the violence of fire. They escaped the edge of the sword. They
    raised the dead from the grave.” Who? Christ! Oh, my, what will it be! Who is He? Christ, the
    Deity! 82 And, brother, sister, that Deity is in you. “A little while and the world seeth Me no
    more. Yet you shall see Me, for I’ll be with you, even in you, to the end of the age.” Christ in
    the manger? No. Christ in you! Hallelujah! We’re not worshipping Christ in the manger, BUT
    CHRIST IN YOU, THE HOLY GHOST, THE HOPE OF LIFE, HALLELUJAH, THE
    CREATOR, GOD HIMSELF DWELLING IN THE HUMAN BEING. “It doth not yet appear
    what we shall be, but we’ll see Him as He is.” For we’ll be made like Him, the Spirit in the
    human being.
     …. (Blank spot-on tape) …Sin…see, it’s not his nature, because he has the nature of Christ.
    And how can he sin? Is that right? (Amen) So this… Paul is really pouring it to this poor brother,
    that wanted to live in a occasional life of sin, so that he might prove the grace of God. Isn’t that,
    right? (Amen) This divine nature impels the believer to hate sin and loves righteousness. It
    impels the believer not to want to cut her hair. It impels the believer to be in subjection to your
    husband. It impels the believer to take on a virtuous look and to be a mold and a model for her
    children and boys. It impels that believer to life the of Sarah, being subjection to her husband and
    calling your husband Abraham Lord. It impels the husband to love his wife even as he loves his
    own flesh. This divine nature does all of these things. True! Right? (Amen)
    1 Peter 3:5-6-Reference quote:
    5 For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned
    themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands:

    well, and are not afraid with any amazement.

    199 Watch of these meetings, these great evangelists, and even in my humble little ministry, not
    excluding me. Sometimes I feel like ashamed, going out. That’s right. What are we to do? Stand
    and make altar calls and persuade them. Little girls come up there, and all chewing chewinggum, say, “See? See? I’m going. Uh-huh.” These women come up there, with bobbed hair and
    painted faces, Pentecostals, and go in, and come out, and say they spoke in tongues. And never
    let their hair grow, and still do the same thing they did. You tell me that’s conversion? That’s a
    mockery of God. Bible said, “It’s a sin and a disgrace for them to cut their hair.” How can a
    woman with bobbed hair condemn a woman that’s got paint on her face? Might as well hear it.
    The hour is coming, till the axe is laid to the root of the tree. And every tree that bringeth forth
    not good fruit is hewed down. 200 What’s the matter? It was wrong. Cause, our modern, socalled preachers out here, big crowd and stuffed shirts. Organizations know no more about God
    than a Hottentot does about Egyptian night, when it comes. They go up there… 201 What if that
    people at Pentecost would have went up there and said, “Now, Jesus commanded us that we
    should go up here and stay till we receive power from on High. Now, brethren, we’ve been here
    nine days, already. Let us accept it, by faith. Now, we have the Holy Ghost. We go out, because
    we’ve been here. We done what Jesus told us to do”? There had never been no experience. 202
    Let me tell you something. I know this is on tape, but here it comes, anyhow. Listen. I’m going to
    tell you something. It’s a shame. People trying to…I’ve never believed that the Holy Ghost was
    “shaking.” I’VE NEVER BELIEVED THAT THE HOLY GHOST WAS “EVIDENCE OF
    SPEAKING IN TONGUES, or crying, or shouting.” Them is emotional sensations. I believe
    the Holy Ghost can do that. BUT THE HOLY GHOST IS TABERNACLING DEITY. I
    BELIEVE A GREAT BUNCH OF PEOPLE THAT CLAIM TO HAVE THE HOLY GHOST
    DON’T KNOW ONE THING ABOUT IT. You meet God. How? The Day of Pentecost! 203
    They said now, like the Baptists today, the Presbyterian and Methodists. I ask, “Do you believe
    you got the…” 204 “Oh, yes, we accept It, by faith.” By faith, nothing! That isn’t It. It’s a
    sensation. 205 You like to see a sunset. You stand and watch the sun go down, and cry, and tears
    run down. That ain’t God. That’s emotion, from something that’s in you. You hear of somebody
    being sick, or someone dying, you scream out and cry. That’s not God. That’s human emotion.
    How God… 206 I’ve seen people at a ball game, get so happy they’d stammer their lips,
    everything else. Don’t tell me. WE’RE IN A NEED OF REVIVAL, A SALVATION. And the
    Pentecostals come around, get the people worked up, and tell them, “When they speak in
    tongues, they got the Holy Ghost.” And some of them live all kinds of lives, afterwards. Listen,
    brother. At the Day of Pentecost, it wasn’t so. They never relied upon any tongues or anything.
    While they were there, standing in one place, in one accord, God came down, literally, among
    them. They saw, on each one of them, licks of Fire, about like that, hanging above their head.
    God was there. It was no, “Accept it by faith, or some emotion.” They were filled with the Holy
    Ghost, and then went out and begin to speak with tongues. But, first, they met God. THAT’S
    WHAT’S THE MATTER TODAY. PEOPLE GET WORKED UP AND EXCITED,
    EMOTION, AND IT’S NOT THE HOLY GHOST. THE HOLY GHOST IS
    TABERNACLING DEITY. Your words is His Words. Tell you, what we need today, is a call.
    
    33
     All right now, we’ll hurrying along. Now here’s another reason why that this person cannot
    live habitually in this sinful nature. And that is the reason God has sent the most greatest
    deterrent to sin that he could send, and that is the Holy Spirit. Because when the Holy Spirit
    comes into your heart the Bible says, “He will reprove the world of sin. He will convict the
    believer of sin.”
    John 16:8-Reference quote:
    8 And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:
     And it makes a very uncomfortable situation, when the believer with the Jesus on the throne
    of His heart to sin, he gets spiritually sweaty. Then he comes and says, “Let me say something to
    you, I shouldn’t of did that to you. Say Sister I’m sorry, for talking about you!” Is that right?
    (Amen) I tell ya, that is a real deterrent to sin is the Baptism of the Holy Ghost. Is that right?
    (Amen)
     The third reason maybe, God sent also another deterrent to stop us. Well, if you won’t… and
    disobey, if you won’t obey the Holy Spirit. If you won’t obey the quacking power of the Holy
    Spirit to convict your conscience, then God will send something along to chastise you, a little
    cancer, a little growth, something else. Is that right? (Amen) He’ll chastise you, and make you
    come back there to repent of that sin.
     So, it is an impossibility for the bride of Jesus Christ to continue to live after the dictates of
    the flesh. Paul said, “That if you live after the flesh, you most surely die. But if you by the Spirit
    do mortify this Evil Nature, ye shall live.” And live more abundantly in the power of the
    resurrection sign.
    Romans 8:12-13-Reference quote:
    12 Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh.
    13 For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of
    the body, ye shall live.

    resurrection sign that Christ has finally, after justification been planted, sanctification been
    planted, baptism of the Holy Ghost. Organizations died out. And Christ has again centered
    Himself like that cap of the pyramid. First line, justification; sanctification; baptism of the

    62-1007 - The Key To The Door
    William Marrion Branham
    136 Now, when I was born into the family of God, I came by the Blood, the Blood give me Life.
    And then after I become alive in Christ, He baptized me with the Holy Ghost and power, to be a
    son of God. Now, just like I could walk, talk like a human being, drive my car like human being.
    NOW WHEN I RECEIVE THE HOLY GHOST, I RECEIVE POWER TO CAST OUT
    DEVILS, TO SPEAK WITH NEW TONGUES, PREACH THE GOSPEL, HEAL THE SICK.
    I AM BAPTIZED! Not born; but baptized! They were gathered in the upper room, All praying
    in His Name, They were baptized with the Holy Ghost, And power for service came. 137 Amen.
    YOU BELIEVE UNTO ETERNAL LIFE, AND ARE BORN AGAIN BY YOUR FAITH. Jesus
    said, in Saint John 5:24, “He that heareth My Words and believeth on Him that sent Me, has
    everlasting life,” not the Holy Ghost, just has everlasting life. He’s born into the family of
    God. And then baptized into the Holy Ghost, with power of the intelligence of faith, to believe
    the Gospel and to put It to work and make It act right. Amen. Then he acts like a son of God.
    Then he can cast out devils. Jesus said, “These signs shall follow them!” See? “In My Name
    they shall cast out devils, speak with new tongues, take up serpents, drink deadly things.” See,
    HE RECEIVES POWER BY THE HOLY GHOST, TO DO THESE THINGS. 138 Now, when
    He went away, He said, “It’s expedient for Me that I go away. For, if I go not away, the Holy
    Ghost will not come.” See? Then when He comes, He will reprove the world of sin, and teach
    righteousness, and show you things to come (that’s visions). “He’ll take the things that I’ve
    taught to you, and reveal them to you.” The very Words that He’s come…No man can
    understand the Word outside the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And when a man says he’s got the
    baptism of the Holy Ghost, and disputes the Word being right, there’s something wrong. 139
    Paul was a critic of the New Testament. It wasn’t, the New Testament wasn’t wrote. Paul was a
    critic of Christianity, Saul. And when he received the Holy Ghost, he went three years down in
    Asia and studied the Scriptures, because he was taught under Gamaliel, a great teacher. Then
    
    35
    when he come back, and fourteen years later, he went up to meet Peter at Jerusalem, and found
    out they were Word and by Word the same Gospel. The same God that had Peter preach on the
    day of Pentecost and tell them to repent and be baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ, that same
    Holy Spirit revealed it to Paul, and he told them in Acts 19 after they had done been baptized one
    time by John, said, “You have to be baptized over again, in the Name of Jesus Christ.” See? 140
    See, the Holy Spirit stays right straight with the Scriptures. ITS FAITH IN THAT UNLOCKS
    EVERY MYSTERY. Amen. The Bible said, in First John 5:7, “There are three that bear record,
    Heaven: the Father, the Word (which was Christ), and the Holy Ghost. These three are One.”
    “And there are three that bear record in earth: water, Blood, Spirit. These three are not one, but
    they agree in one.” Now, you can’t have the Father without having the Son, you can’t have the
    Son without having the Holy Ghost; They are One. But you can be justified without being
    sanctified, and you can be sanctified without having the Holy Ghost. Sanctification is by the
    Blood, through the Blood comes Life. See? And the Holy Ghost is the power of God, see, the
    power given to the church. 141 “YOU SHALL RECEIVE” (WHAT?) “POWER,” ACTS 1:8,
    “AFTER THIS THE HOLY GHOST IS COME UPON YOU. YOU SHALL RECEIVE
    POWER!” (NOT “YOU’LL BE BORN AGAIN.”) “YOU’LL RECEIVE POWER AFTER
    THE HOLY GHOST IS COME UPON YOU. Then you’re My witnesses in Jerusalem, Judaea,
    and Samaria, unto the uttermost parts of the earth.” See? You receive power after you receive
    the Holy Ghost. But first you must receive the Holy Ghost, and that is the power of God, see, to
    manifest and demonstrate. You’re—you’re…as you was a human, and learned to talk and walk
    and do the things a human does; when you’re baptized with the Holy Ghost, you’re given power
    to act as sons and daughters of God. No wonder people act and do the way they do today,
    they’ve never been filled with the Holy Ghost. If they would, they’d act different. They claim they
    have, but Jesus said, “By their fruits you shall know them.” So how can you do it, you see, it’s
    just all scrupled up. See? But come back to the facts!
     Let us order our, the life! Let us order our life now! Believing that the power of the sinful
    nature is broken once and forever. When we will do this, we will be obeying Paul’s instructions
    in verse 12. Look real hurriedly in verse 12 now.
    Romans 5:12-Scripture Reading:
    12 Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof.
     1:10:27 I’d like to speak on this word “Reign.” DON’T NEVER AGAIN THINK THAT
    SATAN AND HIS EVIL NATURE IS REIGNING IN YOUR HEART. BELIEVE THAT
    JESUS CHRIST HAS SEVERED THAT EVIL NATURE. AND THAT HE ALONE IS
    REIGNING AS SUPREME MONARCH IN YOUR HEART! You’re not reigning under that
    evil nature anymore. You don’t have to go do this and talk about this one and do this one and
    talk about your pastor and say, “I don’t like what he preached, I don’t do this, I don’t wanna.
    You don’t have to that no more.”
     You’re not a slave to that Monarch of sin any longer, you’re not a sin slave! YOU’RE A
    LOVE SLAVE OF JESUS CHRIST, He’s your king. Is that right? (Amen) So, don’t let sin
    reign!
    
    36
     A lot of people want…want their sinful nature reigning over them. They can’t help it, they
    just…some just got to talk about everybody. They got to find fault with the assembly, “This ain’t
    right, they holler to loud, oh, I don’t like this, that woman she a… well look at that and this
    brother, oh I can’t stand that, I can’t do this.” Oh, the Satan still reigning on your heart. Kick him
    out this morning! Get him off your throne this morning and take a real-life King Jesus Christ
    take on His righteousness, holiness joy and Peace in the Holy Ghost. Take it on this morning.
     Kick him off your throne this morning. You women kick that King out this morning, kick him
    out and take on a real-life King, a real-life Savior. Take on a new nature that’ll love Holiness,
    Righteousness, Peace and Joy speaking the kind of heavenly joy and Love. Can you say Amen?
    (Amen) Knock him out that old sinful nature, don’t let him reign over you. Let Jesus Christ take a
    hold of the reigns of your heart. He’ll lead you into rivers of living water brother. He’ll let rivers
    of living waters flow out of you, He’ll reign on your heart.
     Now Paul speaks of this lust here now, he’s not talking about this Evil Nature now. The Evil
    Nature is something that you can’t feel or see but it’s real. The lust is the cravings of your natural
    body that you live in. We inherited that from the fall of the first head Adam, WE ARE THE
    SECOND ADAM NOW! Who severed me from that power of that first Adam. Is that right?
    (Amen) Well, I don’t have to follow the dictates of this lust of the flesh any longer, I’m going to
    live by the Spirit and the power of the Almighty God! Is that right? (Amen)

    An Exposition Of The Seven Church Ages - 5 - The Pergamean Church Age
    William Marrion Branham
    And there it is. You CAN’T claim that manifestation is the evidence of being Spirit-born, Spiritfilled. No sir. I will admit that true manifestation is the evidence of the Holy Spirit doing mighty
    acts, but it is NOT the evidence of the individual being Spirit-filled, even though that individual
    has an abundance of those manifestations. The evidence of receiving the Holy Ghost today is just
    the same as it was back in the day of our Lord. IT IS RECEIVING THE WORD OF TRUTH
    FOR THE DAY IN WHICH YOU LIVE. JESUS NEVER DID STRESS THE IMPORTANCE
    OF THE WORKS AS HE DID THE WORD. HE KNEW THAT IF THE PEOPLE GOT THE
    WORD THE WORKS WOULD FOLLOW. That is Bible. Now Jesus knew that there was going
    to be a terrible drift away from the Word in the Pergamean Age which was as yet two hundred
    years off from the Patmos vision. He knew that drift would cause them to go into the Dark Ages.
    He knew that the way man originally got away from God was by first leaving the Word. If you
    leave that Word, you have left God. Thus He is presenting Himself to the church at Pergamos,
    and indeed to all churches of all ages, “I AM THE WORD. IF YOU WANT DEITY IN YOUR
    MIDST, THEN WELCOME AND RECEIVE THE WORD. Don’t ever let anyone or anything
    get between you and that Word. THIS WHICH I AM GIVING YOU (THE WORD) IS A
    REVELATION OF MYSELF. I AM THE WORD. REMEMBER THAT!” I wonder if we are
    sufficiently impressed with the Word in our midst. Let me give you a thought here. How do we
    pray? We pray in Jesus Name don’t we? Every prayer is in His Name or there isn’t any answer.
    Yet in I John 5:14 we are told, “This is the confidence that we have in Him, that, if we ask
    anything according to His will, He heareth us: and if we know that He hear us, whatsoever we
    ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of Him.” Now we ask, “What is the will
    of God?” There is only ONE WAY to know His will and that is by the WORD OF GOD.
    
    37
    Lamentations 3:37, “Who is he that saith, and it cometh to pass, when the Lord commandeth it
    not?” There it is. If it isn’t in the Word you can’t have it. So we can’t ask unless it’s in the Word,
    and we can’t petition or ask unless it is in His Name. There it is again. JESUS (the Name) is the
    WORD (will). You can’t separate God and the Word. They are ONE. Now then, this Word He
    has left behind on the printed page is a part of HIM WHEN YOU ACCEPT IT BY FAITH
    into a Spirit-filled life. He said that His Word was life. John 6:63b. But that is exactly what He
    is: John 14:6, “I AM THE WAY, THE TRUTH, AND THE LIFE.” Romans 8:9b, “If any man
    have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of His.” There it is, He is Spirit and He is Life. That is
    exactly what the Word is; that is exactly what Jesus is. He is the Word. SO WHEN A SPIRITBORN, SPIRIT-FILLED MAN IN FAITH TAKES THAT WORD INTO HIS HEART AND
    PLACES IT UPON HIS LIPS, WHY THAT IS THE SAME AS DEITY SPEAKING. EVERY
    MOUNTAIN HAS TO GO. SATAN CANNOT STAND BEFORE THAT MAN. If the church,
    way back there in that third age had only held on to the revelation of the living Word in their
    midst, the power of God would not have faded as it did in those Dark Ages. AND RIGHT
    TODAY, WHEN THE CHURCH RETURNS TO THE WORD IN FAITH, WE CAN SAY
    WITHOUT DOUBT THAT THE GLORY OF GOD AND THE WONDERFUL ACTS OF
    GOD WILL BE IN HER MIDST AGAIN. One night as I was seeking the Lord, the Holy Spirit
    told me to pick up my pen and write. As I grasped the pen to write, His Spirit gave me a message
    for the church. I want to bring it to you. It has to do with the Word and the bride. Here is what I
    am trying to say to you. The law of reproduction is that each specie brings forth after its own
    kind, even according to Genesis 1:11, “And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, and the
    herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the
    earth: and it was so.” Whatever life was in the seed came forth into a plant and thence into fruit.
    The very same law applies to the church today. Whatever seed started the church will come forth
    and be like the original seed because it is the same seed. IN THESE LAST DAYS THE TRUE
    BRIDE CHURCH (CHRIST’S SEED) WILL COME TO THE HEADSTONE, AND SHE
    WILL BE THE SUPER CHURCH, A SUPER RACE, AS SHE NEARS HIM. THEY IN THE
    BRIDE WILL BE SO MUCH LIKE HIM THAT THEY WILL EVEN BE IN HIS VERY
    IMAGE. THIS IS IN ORDER TO BE UNITED WITH HIM. THEY WILL BE ONE. THEY
    WILL BE THE VERY MANIFESTATION OF THE WORD OF THE LIVING GOD.
    Denominations cannot produce this (wrong seed). They will produce their creeds and their
    dogmas, mixed with the Word. This mongrelizing brings forth a hybrid product. The first son
    (Adam) was the spoken seed-Word of God. HE WAS GIVEN A BRIDE TO REPRODUCE
    HIMSELF. THAT IS WHY THE BRIDE WAS GIVEN TO HIM, TO REPRODUCE
    HIMSELF; TO PRODUCE ANOTHER SON OF GOD. But she fell. She fell by hybridization.
    She caused him to die. THE SECOND SON (JESUS), ALSO A SPOKEN SEED-WORD OF
    GOD WAS GIVEN A BRIDE LIKE AS WAS ADAM. But before He could marry her, she also
    had fallen. She, like Adam’s wife, was put to the test whether she would believe the Word of God
    and live, or doubt the Word and die. She doubted. She left the Word. She died. From a little
    group of the true seed of the Word, God will present Christ with a beloved bride. She is a
    virgin of His Word. She is a virgin because she knows no man-made creeds or dogmas. By and
    through the members of the bride will be fulfilled all that was promised of God to be made
    manifest in the virgin. The word of promise came to the virgin Mary. But that Word of
    promise was He, Himself, to be made manifest. God was made manifest. He, Himself, acted at
    that time and fulfilled His own Word of promise in the virgin. It was an angel that had
    brought her the message. But the angel’s message was the Word of God. Isaiah 9:6. He
    
    38
    fulfilled at that time all that was written of Him because SHE ACCEPTED HIS WORD TO
    HER. The members of the virgin bride will love Him, and they will have His potentials, for He
    is their head, and all power belongs to Him. They are subject to Him as the members of our
    bodies are subject to our heads. Notice the harmony of the Father and the Son. Jesus never did
    anything until it was first showed Him by the Father. John 5:19. This harmony is now to exist
    between the Groom and His bride. HE SHOWS HER HIS WORD OF LIFE. SHE
    RECEIVES IT. She never doubts it. Therefore, nothing can harm her, not even death. FOR
    IF THE SEED BE PLANTED, THE WATER WILL RAISE IT UP AGAIN. HERE IS THE
    SECRET OF THIS. THE WORD IS IN THE BRIDE (AS IT WAS IN MARY). THE BRIDE
    HAS THE MIND OF CHRIST FOR SHE KNOWS WHAT HE WANTS DONE WITH THE
    WORD. She performs the command of the Word in His name for she has “thus saith the
    Lord.” Then the Word is quickened by the Spirit and it comes to pass. Like a seed that is
    planted and watered, it comes to full harvest, serving its purpose. Those in the bride do only His
    will. No one can make them do otherwise. They have “thus saith the Lord” or they keep still.
    They know that it has to be God in them doing the works, fulfilling His own Word. HE DID NOT
    COMPLETE ALL HIS WORK WHILE IN HIS EARTHLY MINISTRY SO NOW HE
    WORKS IN AND THROUGH THE BRIDE. She knows that, for it was not yet time for Him to
    do certain things that He must now do. BUT HE WILL NOW FULFILL THROUGH THE
    BRIDE THAT WORK WHICH HE LEFT FOR THIS SPECIFIC TIME.
     Well, I tell ya you see what a Christian is now don’t you? (Amen) You see what the Holy
    Ghost is now don’t you? (Amen) It’s the divine nature of Jesus Christ! Our responsibility is to
    keep a constant attitude of opposition to this Evil Nature and the dictates of this cravings of this
    body. Thereby, now you can’t watch this Evil Nature to good, but if you will watch the cravings
    of your body. If it craves to talk about your brother, it’s finding it’s power and source in the evil
    nature. Now, the way that you speak and the way that you act, proves what power you’re
    walking in.
     I heard a lot of preachers preach under a power, but the walk that I seen them walk proved
    they were ministering under the power of their anointing of their Evil Nature. Satan takes control
    of that Evil Nature and anoints that Evil Nature. That Evil Nature can preach, that Evil Nature
    can speak in tongues, that Evil Nature can prophesy. That Evil Nature is out here is building all
    kinds of churches and denominations, to take them over to the tribulations and burn them.
     But I’m telling you, that the divine nature of Jesus Christ is here tonight to clean up the body
    of Jesus Christ. “WITHOUT HOLINESS NO MAN SHALL SEE GOD! WITHOUT
    HOLINESS NO MAN SHALL ENTER INTO THE KINGDOM OF GOD.”
    Hebrews 12:14-Reference quote:
    14 Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord:
     JESUS CHRIST’S DIVINE NATURE IS HERE TO RESURRECT A BODY OF JESUS
    CHRIST, TO PLANT A NEW POWER PLANT DOWN INSIDE OF YOU, TO RAPTURE
    YOU FROM THE EVIL NATURE. Amen!

     The believer therefore, should watch the cravings of his flesh. He should watch what his ears

    (Amen)
     So, when you see a sister looking at these women magazines and fashion, oh, and all this.
    Living in the strength of the Evil Nature. When you see a sister reading her Bible and praying,
    letting her hair grow long and believe in holiness and all the other full gospel people said, “Why
    don’t you cut your hair and get a permanent? You look terrible!” Serpent! Got a serpent in his
    heart, or either he’s living in the power of the sinful nature, either one. Is that right? (Amen)
     This word servant now. Want to take this servant for just a minute. This word servant in the
    Greek it’s a word called doulos. The Greeks had a word for a man who was a slave that was
    captured during war time. This is not what that means. He was a slave because of circumstances.
    But this word servant here, don’t yield yourself to this servant.
    Endnote:
    The Greek word for servant is doulos, and it means slave. In biblical times, a doulos was
    someone who belonged to another.
     This word doulos means, it refers to one who is a slave by birth. And when you were born
    from your mother’s womb you became a slave to that sinful nature. And that power of that sinful
    nature, drug you to your grave and it never did break it’s hold.
    
    41
     Satan had you in such a grip of that Evil nature, he gripped you when you were born from
    your mother’s womb and that devil drug you to your grave and then drug you to hell to burn
    forever and ever.
     But now, this word doulos, means one that is born of a birth. He has inherited the most servile
    term of slavery that could be had. Once he was a servile slave to Satan, to end up in hell finally.
    But now by the power and by the Grace of Jesus Christ that Evil Nature and the power Satan has
    been broken and he is reigning as king. And we are now Born Again by the Baptism of the Holy
    Ghost into a new union, into a New Birth to live as a slave a love slave of Jesus Christ until death
    and then live with him forever and ever. Can you raise your hands and say, “Amen!?”
     Now wonder Paul said, “How ridiculous it is to say shall we that have had the grace of God in
    our life, live any longer in its lust thereof.” Is that right? (Amen)
     The word servant, is one who is bound to another in bond so strong that only death can break
    them. Is that right? (Amen) Before salvation brought its work in the believer he was bound to
    Satan in bonds and only death could break. He chained him and bound him to those bars, he
    chained him and bound him to those prostitute houses. He chained and bound him to the lust of
    the dictates of his cravings of his body. Is that right? (Amen)
     Those poor people that are bound by the power of this world denominations. Those poor
    people that are helt and bound by the power of this world denominations. Those poor people that
    are held in bonds and in chains by this Full Gospel men that are leading them into a devil’s hell.
    Poor preachers. Is that right? (Amen)

    with His Word and with His power, and loose them from the strength of them denominations
    and organizations! How many sincere people in this city, this morning, that goes to these great
    organization churches, how many could He fill with the Holy Ghost, and set this country afire
    with the Gospel and the power, if they’d only take and loose themselves from the power that
    they have and be bound by His Spirit, to be as Paul was, a love slave to God! 105 God took
    Paul and made a slave out of him, bound him to Himself and sent him to the Gentiles which
    he hated. But, you see, he had to be loosed from his ecclesiastical power, to be bound to the
    power of God. He had to lose his strength and become weak and nothing, in order to receive
    the strength of God, to be bound to God, to do what God would tell him to do.

    CHURCH ONLY REALIZED ITS POWER TO DO THESE THINGS. But there’s so much
    doubt and fear and trembling, wondering if it will, “Could it happen?” As long as that exists, the
    Church can never stand upright. And when every talk of fear is vanished and the Holy Spirit is
    
    42
    completely in control of the Church, then all fears are gone, and that Church has the power.
    See? Why, they have everything that Heaven owns behind them. They’re ambassadors of the
    Throne. Absolutely! An ambassador of Christ has the authority, and everything that Christ owns
    belongs to that ambassador. And He said, “GO YE INTO ALL THE WORLD, YOU ARE MY
    WITNESSES AFTER THE HOLY GHOST IS COME ON YOU.” And what is a witness? Is an
    ambassador; is to come and witness something. THE WHOLE POWERS OF HEAVEN IS

     When he was chained and in bonds to Satan, he loved what Satan loved, namely sin. He hated
    what Satan hated namely righteousness. True brothers? (Amen) Is that right? (Amen) But now we
    love what God loves and we hate what God hates and we love holiness.
     I remember when I first started preaching, and the Full Gospel preachers the move of God
    otherwards the sons of God, the Elijah’s. Made fun of me ridiculed me at the Americana Hotel in
    front of all them people, because I preached holiness, laughed at me. And I said, “My friends”, I
    said, “You shouldn’t say that.” I don’t remember exactly what I said. I said, “I don’t want to talk
    about it.” But I said, “One day you’ll meet a real son of God, and with the word of God he’ll cut
    you off from the Kingdom of God. And I believe your already cut off. You know where that
    brother went right after that? Backslid and went into the assemblies of God and is a hard out

     BETTER NOT EVER MAKE FUN OF NOBODY THAT’S LIVING HOLINESS! Don’t
    ever make fun of any woman that’s not cutting her hair and that’s in subjection to her husband.
    Because the Bible said, “That if you offend these little ones that believes in me, it would be
    better for a millstone were hung around your neck AND YOU WERE CAST IN THE DEPTHS
    OF THE SEA!” Brother we better watch out.

    will live holiness and live righteousness until the day that God takes him from this earth. Is that
    right? (Amen) A man that’s filled with the Holy Ghost, though he doesn’t have a wife you could
    put him in a room with a bunch of women. The Bible said, “He that is in you, is greater than he
    
    43

     The word doulos in this Greek word servant means; one who’s will is swallowed up in the
    will of another. It also means, one who serves another as the disregard of his own interests.
     Do you want to serve the Lord Jesus, the lovely Savior God of the universe that came down
    and died for you? Have you or are you tired this morning of obeying the dictates of your Evil
    Nature which is severed by the power of God when you became a Christian. Are you tired this
    morning; are you weary of not being able to overcome that Evil Nature? Do you want this

    brothers, my pastors and fellow minister associate pastor brother Anthony, you forgive me.
    You’ll forgive me for keeping you so long. Oh, I want to be in an apostolic church. Oh, I want to
    really live for God, I want Jesus to be the master king and reigning upon the throne of my heart. I
    don’t want a ministry of popularity, I turned that down. I want a ministry of reconciliation and of
    edification to the saints of God. I want to love my brothers and my sisters. I want to see my
    sisters filled with the dynamic power of God, that they may live a Holy and a Righteous life
    before Jesus Christ.
     I mean to tell you that Jesus Christ is alive. I mean to tell you that Jesus Christ is here to give
    out his word and then to back up that word by giving you the Holy Spirit this morning. JESUS
    CHRIST WILL FILL EVERY ONE OF YOU THIS MORNING WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT.

     I wonder if there is one in our midst, that does not know the Lord in the power of his
    resurrection, who’s been playing church and has probably went in churches and probably is very
    religious, but have not met the Lord, this hour is the day of your salvation. The Lord has spoke to
    us this morning, we’re not looking for religion, we’ve come for salvation this morning. Is there
    one this morning who wants salvation, who doesn’t want to take on a church denominational
    name, but wants Jesus to reign on his throne. If there’s one, will you come? Will you come this
    morning? Will you be seated please? Will you turn to page 334?

     Bless the Lord! If there’s one in our midst who is a sinner, who doesn’t know Jesus Christ in

    morning, you’ve heard the Lord speak through our brother you’ve heard the interpretation of the
    word. We’re waiting for you this morning. The song writer said, “shadows are gathering,
    deathbeds are coming.” Coming for you, but not for me, they’re not coming for the saved and
    sanctified, the filled with the everlasting Holy Ghost. For they have eternal life. It is offered to

    Robert Lee Lambert
    Sure they spoke in tongues, but what was it? More than likely it was the devil cussing God.
    That's why I find most of the people that come here, at first in prayer meeting speak in
    tongues. But after they sit here a while under the Word, that leaves them. Now, if the Word of
    God will take it away from you, it shows it wasn't God. And if you can turn God on
    like you turn a faucet on in the sink, just turn it on and off, brother you ain’t got the God I’m
    speaking about, see. Now that goes to show you there... You see what happen, that when a man
    tries to approach God and don’t come by the correct approach he may be approaching an evil
    spirit and don’t know it. THERE’S ONLY TWO SPIRITS IN THE WORLD AND THAT’S
    GOD’S SPIRIT AND THE DEVIL’S SPIRIT. AND THERE’S ONLY ONE WAY TO
    APPROACH GOD AND THAT’S THE WAY THAT HE LAID DOWN IN THE WORD. Now
    let God’s word be true and every man found a liar. But you say, “I know a man.” Well, I know
    plenty of them to. Well I know...Well I do to. But let Gods word be true and every man found a
    liar. There’s only one way to God! Only one!

    34 Now, I would suggest this so that the sanctuary will only be ministered by one gift at a time,
    for it brings us straight back in order again of what I’m trying to say: if one’s speaking, let the
    spirit of the prophets be subject to the prophet. Do you understand? Now, let those who have a
    ministry to the Body of Christ…And now it’s being said, now let it be done. Let those who have a
    ministry to the Body of Christ wait on their ministry, because it is a ministry from Christ to the
    church. But you can’t all minister the same time, there’s got to be one at a time. 35 The
    Branham Tabernacle shall be like this. Let those who speak with tongues, and those who
    interpret tongues, and those have prophecy that’s to be given to the church, let them come
    among themselves early in the…before the meeting starts, let them gather in an appointed
    room, and wait on the ministry of the Lord. 36 As the pastor has to do himself before he comes
    into the audience; he must take the Bible, study in the quietness of his room, in the Spirit, and be
    anointed to come out before the audience to speak. If he doesn’t, he’s going to be confused when
    he gets out there. (Let each man and each woman, with a spiritual gift, come before the Lord.)
    And being that the pastor has a single ministry, he is a prophet; the English word, a preacher,
    means “a prophet,” that’s a forth-teller of the Word. 37 Let those who have ministries that has
    to be part of someone else, like one to speak with tongues and another to interpret, they wait
    together on their ministry. They cannot stay in a private study and speak in tongues and then
    come tell the other one what he said, because he’d have both tongues and interpretation. See?
    Now, if he has that, very well, we want to receive it like that. And we want the church to benefit
    by these gifts that’s in our church. God sent them to us, and it’s…we want our church to benefit
    by these spiritual gifts. So let the man who speaks with tongues, and the one who interprets, and
    the one who prophesies, let them come together before the—the church ever meets. Let them
    meet in a room to themselves, waiting on the ministry of the Lord to the church. Is it
    understood? 38 And then, like this, if Brother Neville, say, well, now let me, pardon me, let me
    say this: If Brother Collins speaks with tongues and Brother Hickerson gives the interpretation,
    then they have a ministry together for the church. Now, that isn’t the ministry of Brother Neville;
    that’s your ministry to the church. I’m giving this as example. Then you brethren should be just
    as interested in getting your ministry in the place in the house of God as the pastor is interested
    in getting his, because it’s just as essential that you do it. But you can’t do it in the privacy of
    your own room, if you speak and you interpret, you’ve got to come together. Now, come
    together in the church, off in a room to yourself, because you have a private ministry. It’s not
    an openly ministry, it’s one that’s to help the church. See? It’s something to help the church,
    but it isn’t to be done in the main congregation, only the way I’m going to tell you it is to be
    done. See? Then, whatever Brother Collins speaks, and Brother Hickerson gives the
    interpretation, as example, then let Brother Somebody write this down, what it is. And then if it’s
    coming… 39 Now, we all know that the Lord is coming, we’re aware of that. And if Brother
    Neville got up each night and said, “Behold, the Lord is coming! Behold, the Lord is coming!”
    that would be all right, see. But he’s saying that (the pastor) at the platform, for he’s got the
    Word for that. And if he be a pastor, prophet to the church…or a pastor, rather, he’s to study the
    Word of the Lord and tell you what’s written in the Word of the Lord about the coming of the
    Lord, and you’re warned by that. A ministry otherwise (to the church) which he wouldn’t have
    any connection with, is tongues, interpretation of tongues (which is prophecy), or a prophet
    
    47
    speaking, that’s something that’s not written in the Word. What’s written in the Word, he’s to
    bring it; but what’s not written in the Word, is what you’re to tell him. Like, for instance, “Tell
    Brother Wheeler, THUS SAITH THE LORD, ‘Tomorrow, in his sand pit, not to go to it, because
    there’ll be a truck turn over,’” or something like that, and it’s got to be done. And you’ve spoke
    it and he’s interpreted it, and then lay that on the platform after your ministry is finished,
    then, in the night, after the church (the hymn) start singing and so forth; if your ministry is
    finished then, let them come forth with what prophecy has been given. 40 And I do not think
    that we have…Or if you do, put this in there. When these people meet together, let them who
    have wisdom first come. Because, you see, if one speaks in tongues and gives an interpretation
    according to Scripture, that cannot be received unless it be witnessed by two or three people,
    two or three more witnesses, see, has to witness to that, that they believe it to be the Word of
    the Lord. Because…And sometimes in these minor ministries, just like in any other ministry, you
    get spirits that’s wrong; see, they’ll fly in there. And we don’t want that. No. We want these
    ministries ready to be exposed if they’re to be exposed, because anything of God can…you don’t
    worry about exposing it, I mean, it’ll—it’ll stand the test, if it’s of God.
     Almighty God, we sit in reverence Lord waiting upon thee. Bless the Lord! Do you realize we
    are living in the hour where you are speaking to us more and more Lord? We wait Lord for the
    divine interpretation Lord. We know your presence is in our midst Lord. The word says you are.
    Oh God, we wait on thee Lord as little children Lord, looking by faith oh God. Waiting for thee

    You’re showing forth an honest effort. If the Word has went forth in the Holy Spirit…The trouble
    of it is with we Pentecostal people, we get too self-seeded. See? God wants to make us different.
    God wants to put that in our hearts. He wants us to be real. Listen, friends. Let me tell you this.
    WHY TAKE A SUBSTITUTE WHEN THE PENTECOSTAL SKIES ARE LOADED WITH
    THE REAL THING? Why try to lay upon some fantastic? Why try to rely upon some little
    emotion? Or some little something another there’s nothing to, when Pentecostal skies are just
    crowded with the real thing. DON’T TAKE A SUBSTITUTE WHEN YOU CAN GET THE
    REAL. 67 Paul said, “All these things I do, they’ll pass away. Our tongues will cease;
    everything else will go; but when love has come, it will endure forever.” Sure, don’t take a
    substitute. NO, SIR. I WANT THE REAL ONE, OR I WANT TO LEAVE. I want to be a real

    want no hidden sin in our mist Lord. Oh God, and when an unbeliever comes in our midst Lord,
    let your presence be so strong oh God, that his very knees might knock Lord. And bring him in
    subjection Lord. For we Believe in you Lord, oh God we’re living for you Lord. Oh God, we ask
    oh God, that you make your power so strong Lord that we won’t be able to stand it Lord. Oh
    God, continue to bless us Lord! For we ask it in Jesus name and for his glory amen.

   Let us remain standing. And if you’ll bow your heads with me in a word of prayer to the Lord.
   Opening Prayer: by Robert Lambert
   Almighty God that did create the heavens and the earth by thy precious word, has by thy
   word in these last days given us a Restoration of the true Apostolic Doctrine of which we are so
   grateful that we are able to sing this song that we sang tonight, “Onward Christian Soldiers,” one
   faith and one doctrine and one Lord and one baptism. We thank You for these things, Father, for
   through them, Lord, we are able to have fellowship one with another without splitting and
   differences but we are able to love one another because these doctrines have brought us a
   persecution, Lord, and have driven us together that we may be one as you have spoken of in your
   word. Of these things we are very grateful to you, Father God.
   And we pray tonight, Father, that you will come and bless us because we love thee and
   we desire to have you in our presence so very much Lord. We give praises unto thee that you
   come down and bless us. So, Father, we have no differences with one another, Lord. I don't
   know of anyone here tonight that doesn't love me. I don't know anyone here, Lord, that I don't
   love. So, Father, I pray, God, that if there is anyone here tonight that would have an ought in
   their heart against their brother, please, Lord Jesus, may they make it right tonight that we might
   be able to climb up a little higher with thee, Father, that you might be able, Lord, to bless us in a
   greater way.
   Remember thy servant and thy messenger tonight and, Father, we pray that thou will
   comfort and bless him, that thou will continually bless his ministry in a tremendous way,
   Lord. Stop up the mouth of the gainsayers and let the word of God go forth with power that
   cometh down on Mount Sinai that would cause the disbelievers to wonder, Lord. Now, Father,
   bless me and help me, Lord. And, Lord, have mercy upon me, Father, and forgive me of my
   sins. Cover them in the Blood of Jesus Christ. May you only hear my voice tonight and not see
   me, Lord, and, Lord, come and minister to us the word of God. In Jesus Christ's
   Name. Amen. You may be seated.
   Jesus is wonderful. Jesus, well he's just Jesus. If you never met him, you need to. I'm
   telling you I'm just so happy I don't know what to do. I hate New York City but I sure do love
   this assembly. I believe it's worth living in Sodom to be able to come here. I'm quite sure, if
   some of the other members of the Bride knew how the golden Oil of the Holy Spirit was being so
   lavishly poured out in our midst, they would be contemplating moving here to Sodom, even if
   the area is unclean. God is able to sanctify it. If the Pope was able to throw some kind of stuff
   into that old nasty Mississippi River and call it holy…. It's the dirtiest river I know of with all
   the other rivers and the sewers emptying into it. He was able to sanctify it and make it clean. God
   ought to be able, through the prayer of the saints, to sanctify the place. Amen?
   2
   Well, to those who would be in our midst tonight, who might be strangers to us. First we
   would like to welcome you here to the Local Christian Assembly. We don't have no strange
   doctrines. The only doctrines that we have are Bible doctrines. They are old doctrines and they
   have been handed down to us from our apostolic father, Brother Peter, to Brother Bob.
   We would like to say that none of these doctrines have been handed to us through any
   school or college or any denomination. We have no creed but Christ and we have no other things
   to give you other than the word of God. We have no great choir but our saints do love to sing the
   songs of Zion. Amen?
   We'd like to give you a hearty welcome tonight. We would like to tell you if you don't
   know now; if you’ll look around and look at the people, they’re full of love and we love all and
   we'll be very happy for you if you don't have a church home to make this your church home.
   Incidentally, if you’re wondering tonight who I am, I'm just another little minister here
   and this is my home assembly. I live several hundred miles away and it's difficult to get here
   every meeting. However, I wish the Lord could so arrange it that it could be. Amen?
   Are you happy? Do you love the Lord Jesus? Would you think about maybe trading the
   Lord Jesus for something in the world, maybe? Do you know anything? There’s nothing is it? No
   wonder Solomon cried, brothers, "All is vanity." He said he tried everything and all of it was
   vanity. Well, the greatest thing we have in common tonight would be that we love the Lord
   Jesus.
   Now if you say that you love the Lord Jesus and you don't obey his word then, well, we
   don't know about that. Is that right! So, because we love the Lord Jesus we want to look into his
   word tonight to see if he will enable us to be better Christians. Now if you’ll kindly open your
   Bibles to I Corinthians 9:24. Read’s like this.
   After the lesson that we had this morning and I would like to see your hands if you
   believe that God had something in that message this morning that will enable you to be a better
   soldier for this Lord Jesus Christ that we love and for your precious Local Christian Assembly. If
   you believe that message has helped you and that enabled you to find out more about yourself
   and more about how you will be able to be an overcomer, let's see your hand. You are wanting to
   go up into a higher level with the Lord Jesus. You’ll be able to do that by looking at the word of
   God and making adjustment in our daily experience, our daily walk. We will be able to move
   into a higher plane with the Lord Jesus and only this way. Just prayer and just coming to service
   will not move you into a higher plane but you must….
   I think we all have a sound intelligent mind and through this mind that the Lord has given
   us, he said to make it intelligent as possibly we can. Though you may be dumb according to the
   world but yet you can be intelligent in the things of God. And since we have this mind then we
   want to adjust it in such a fashion with the word of God that we might be able to know what we
   are fighting and how we are able to overcome our opponents and how that we’ll be able to please
   the Lord Jesus. We can only do this by coming to service, by loving one another, by the word of
   God and obeying the word of God and putting into practice what we have learned up here. Let us
   read now. I Corinthians 9:24-27
   The subject that I will like to teach on tonight is, “A Spiritual Race, the Spiritual
   Athlete.”
   3
   I Corinthians 9:24-27
   (24) Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth
   the prize? So run, that ye may obtain.
   (25) And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all
   things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible.
   (26) I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that
   beateth the air;
   (27 )But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by
   any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.
   I'd like to talk on that word, “castaway.” It's such a wonderful word. But however, I
   would just go on because there are so many good things in there to talk about. Now, as I said
   before, we would like to speak on, “A Spiritual Race” and I'd like for you to tune your mind into
   making a picture in front of you of an athlete that is training to run track, what we call here
   in America, “run track.” Incidentally, I preached on this before but I thought maybe if God
   would bless it I would preach it again to you. Joe was an athlete, a runner. He ran track so he’ll
   be able to understand this very well and I hope that you will also.
   Now Paul is saying here to you… Let us go ahead and read Timothy while I'm at it, the
   Second book of Timothy, Second Timothy, second chapter, and if you would look in the fifth
   verse only. Right now, if you would just look at the fifth verse:
   2 Timothy 2:5
   And if a man also strive for masteries, yet He is not crowned, except he
   strive lawfully.
   Same words that he was speaking about over there, talking about a mastery, a mastery
   and striving. Now, I'd like to call your attention to why Paul was talking about an athlete here to
   Timothy. In the first place, Paul was living in an age of great athletes. They had the great
   Olympic games, as they would call them, and everybody was athletic minded. All their attention
   and all of their energy was put upon the outward man to make it big and muscular and
   strong. They beat one another to death in these games and so their whole life was centered
   around how strong those men, could make their bodies.
   Paul was trying to put a point over here to Timothy. That’s why that he was able to speak
   on this manner. If you’ll notice here that, first, Paul was talking up here in the other part of the
   Scriptures about a soldier and Paul said the words, “soldier of Jesus Christ.” Paul said he would
   liken that unto the Roman Legionnaires who were in the service of their emperor. Paul said to
   Timothy, "Timothy, endure hardship like these Roman Legionnaires. Timothy, I want you to be
   able to endure these hardships of the gospel with me, but Timothy if you see these Legionnaires,
   Roman Legionnaires who are holding the Jews in captivity and in prison, he said, if they’re able
   to endure all these hardships just for their Roman Emperor, how much more should you
   Timothy, since He's called you as a young soldier into the army of the Lord Jesus Christ and He
   is the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords, how much more should you be able to endure
   hardships? If these Roman Legionnaires can do this, Timothy, how much more should you be
   4
   able to do it?" Then he went on to say, "Timothy, no man that warreth entangles himself with the
   affairs of this life that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier."
   In other words, he said, "Timothy, forget about everything else, that you've had, anything
   to do with in this other life that you were living and lay everything aside and don't entangle
   yourself with nothing but the supreme thought of being a good soldier for Jesus Christ."
   Now this Word, “warreth” means to make a military expedition. It means to do military
   duty, be on active service to be engaged in a continual warfare. Now, you and I in order to run
   this race must realize that we are soldiers for Jesus Christ and that we are on a military
   expedition of the Lord Jesus Christ and we are his ambassadors. And He has given us, as His
   ambassadors, everything that we need for this battle that we are fighting and for this race that we
   are running. He has furnished everything that we need to be able to be the soldier that we need to
   be. Is that understood? Now, as I said, from this figure of a soldier, this Roman Legionnaire that
   Paul was speaking to Timothy about, he turns immediately to these great Greek athletes, of
   which you see the statues in the museums and everything. Is that right! You see the books today
   of the men standing like this, well they got that from these great Greek athletes that fought in
   these tremendous coliseums, whatever they called them, where they beat one another to death
   and blood just flowed everywhere, great big biceps and everything. Paul turns to that of a soldier
   to Timothy and speaks of this Greek athlete and this is what we want to dwell on.
   Now this Greek athlete strived and struggled to build himself a great body to receive a
   crown, which they called a wreath, here Paul spoke of, to receive a crown, a wreath. This victor
   who was a victor of this race would win a wreath that would crown that would come down on his
   head and it was made of ivory, laurel and roses and all kind of little flowers and he won this
   crown. Brother Anthony, the only way that he could win it is that he went according to the
   prescribed rules that were laid down, that he strived lawfully. And the only way that you and I
   will ever be able to receive the crown of eternal Life and righteousness that God will give us in
   that day is that we strive lawfully.
   The only way that we can strive lawfully and that is to obey the word of God. You cannot
   break the rules of this game. For you to break the rules and not love your brother, you are
   disqualified. You are annulled from even entering into this race. That's why Paul said, "Though
   that I may have preached to you I fear that lest myself would be a castaway." Paul didn't mean
   castaway from eternal life—he had eternal life, but Paul meant that he might be a castaway, that
   he might be disqualified, in other words, of running this race of patience that was set before him
   that he might be conformed into the Image of the son of Jesus Christ. That was Paul's race that
   he was running, that he might be conformed and molded and made into a real Son of God
   like.... And Paul said that God had chosen him to show forth the Son of God in him first.
   Paul was the first one to be able to run this race and by the Grace of God he won it. He
   set his face out to win that race and he did win it. Is, that right? Paul said, "Timothy, think about
   it, though you may give your whole life to the Lord Jesus Christ, lay down everything in the
   world, you're going to win more than they are Timothy. The best that they could win is the
   praises of man and a little wreath upon their head with a few roses in it. But Timothy, you will
   receive a crown of righteousness which the Lord Jesus Christ will give you in that day, an
   incorruptible crown. That crown that those athletes won that they strived so hard and sweated
   and beat themselves for ten months of training, the best that they won was a wreath."
   Brother, we win an everlasting crown of righteousness which shall never pass
   away. Glory to God! I tell you, that's worth running for. Can you say, Amen?
   5
   Paul said, "Think of that Timothy!” This Greek athlete had to train ten months of
   preparatory training before he was even allowed to get on the track for running. He trained hard
   for ten months and if he was to break any one of these regulations, he had to completely separate
   himself from everything in his life and set his face like a flint to win that crown that laurel
   wreath crown made up of roses. And he was placed on a rigid diet. And as I said, should he
   break the training rules he was disqualified immediately and barred from even engaging in the
   athletic contest.
   I want to tell you something tonight: You are absolutely disqualified to even run this race
   if you are not baptized the right way. Unless you have been baptized in the Name of the Lord
   Jesus Christ, you cannot enter into this race. Now that's one rule you are going to have to abide
   by if you are going to run this race. Is that right, brother? Now, we saw what the Greek athlete
   was like, what kind of a race was he running. Now I showed you why Paul spoke to Timothy that
   way about a Greek athlete. Now, we will turn it over. I think you got a good spiritual
   understanding of that now. Now, we find here that there is a hindrance to a runner. Is that
   true? Let me go back and start over here though.
   Now, we have certain qualifications that you and I must meet in order to begin this race. I
   think the first thing that you need to do to be able to run this race is to believe on the Lord Jesus
   Christ as your personal Savior, then you should be baptized in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ
   for the remission of your sins. Then I think that you should undoubtedly be baptized with the
   Baptism of the Holy Spirit, then that qualifies you to enter into this preparatory training to win
   this crown—not a corruptible crown but a crown of righteousness which the Lord Jesus Christ
   will give you when you finish the race. True. True? Now, since you and I have never run this
   spiritual race before… I never have. Have you?
   All right. Since we have never run a spiritual race before, God has given us an Instructor,
   the Holy Ghost. Now, He has trained great champions such as Jesus Christ, such as the great
   apostle Paul. What a race Paul ran. What a race for you and I. He has trained such great athletes
   as Mary Magdalene, the Virgin Mary. He has trained such great men as Philip, the evangelist. He
   has had plenty of training and the Holy Spirit is more than qualified to be able to teach you and I
   how to run this race. A great trainer.
   Now, this course that we are to run over is a very hard course. It's filled with all kinds of
   sticks and stones that like to break your bones, plenty of words that want to hurt you. It's filled
   with all kinds of holes and snares. Satan said he set a snare, too. It has plenty of holes and plenty
   of snares, plenty of tribulation.
   It's raining, sometimes you will be running this race and it will be raining. It will
   thundering. It will be lighting. Is that right? Sometimes you'll be running and you won't have
   hardly nothing to eat. You may be stuck off in a corner where there is no assembly, yet you have
   to run right on anyway. Though you may have a hurt here down here inside of you, one leg may
   be hurting but you'll have to run anyway. Listen this is really some race that we are running. It's a
   hard course and we are not just running a mile and a quarter. We’re running until death separates
   us from this body and we go to be with the Lord. We’re not just running a half a mile or two
   miles or three miles but we are going to run this race every day, twenty-four hours a day we have
   to run this race until we lay down our lives... the Lord Jesus Christ.
   We are not to complain about the conditions of this course over which we are to run. But
   we are to give praises and thanksgiving to God for every stone, for every hole, for every snare
   which the Holy Spirit will have you to run. We cannot be backbiting and complaining in any
   6
   fashion because the Holy Spirit, our Instructor, has told us that these things would be. He said,
   "If they made fun of that first athlete, Jesus Christ, where they called Him the master of the
   house of Beelzebub, how much more will they call you that?
   "If they would have received your words," He said, "They would have received
   Mine." But He said, "When you are running this race and they begin to talk about you and they
   begin to persecute you," He said, "Blessed are ye for running this race. Blessed are you. Just
   keep running." If the women while they are running this race begin to let their hair grow long
   and beautiful, begin to wear their dresses to cover their knees…"
   Boy I tell you, if it's anything today to see a woman trying to run her race, brother, with
   no material on, trying to get down like that and pull that dress and trying to stretch that material
   down over her knees. I tell you tonight you’re disqualified from the race if you don't get some
   more material on. Is that right? You know, if you cut off your hair, you are going to be
   disqualified from this race. If the women are not in subjection to their husband I think they
   should be disqualified, brother. Amen? And I think the Holy Spirit, the Instructor, will see to it
   that that's done.
   Now the Holy Spirit, our Instructor in this spiritual race, has given us a very strict diet to
   go on. Now He has told us He does not want us to eat any bread that's cankered. He said,
   "Because if you eat this old cankered doctrine it will make you sick. Therefore, you'll not be able
   to train tomorrow. You won’t feel like running track. Now, I tell ya an athlete just don't feel like
   running if the bread that he has been eating doesn't have anything in it. The bread that these
   churches are trying to feed God's athletes just doesn't have enough vitamins and minerals in it
   that enables them to be able to be a healthy runner. I tell you, but, if you’ll ever eat of that hidden
   manna it puts something down in you that helps you want to run... Glory to God,
   Hallelujah! Am... You will be so full of …?.. to hold you back. (Much shouting and praising
   God.) Is, that right?
   God said, "My runners get hungry," and he said, "I promise to feed every one of them
   that hidden manna." I tell you we don't want no germs… One of those big great athlete that's
   been trained by the great Holy Ghost, one of those great big runners said, "Why is it all tables are
   full of vomit?" The old Isaiah, that great runner said, "All tables are full of vomit. Why an
   athlete can't even get nothing to eat to be able to run around here." Is that right? Why one of
   these great athletes, the great Apostle Jude, I believe it was, why, he said, "It was terrible this
   vomit they was trying to feed us athletes. How can we train on such a diet?" Well, the Holy
   Spirit is saying to us, since we are running this race, he has put the bread there for us and He has
   given us strict orders: “Don't you dare eat nothing else but this true Bread that came down from
   heaven. Don't you dare because it will get you all cankered up and you won't be able to run."
   Now He said, "Runners," the Holy Spirit said, "In order to run tomorrow you are going to
   have to have a strong prayer life. That's the main thing." He said, "Because the first runner I
   trained was Jesus." And He said, "After He had run all day long, he had healed the sick, he
   opened the blinded eyes, He had fed the multitudes," He said, "Instead of sleeping now this
   runner that I was training went out into a mountain and there He prayed all night long in prayer
   to be able to run the next day." Is, that right? A strong prayer life is needed to be able to run this
   race.
   Now this great Instructor, the Holy Spirit said, "Student Athletes, if you are going to be a
   great athlete and a faithful runner you’re going to have to overcome the things of the
   world. Make up your mind right now. When prayer meeting night comes, you are not going to be
   7
   able to stay home and watch television, if you are going to run this race." That's what’s the
   matter. It has disqualified a lot of people and they stay home and watch television, broke
   training. You can't make an athlete like that.
   Now He said, "All these runners that I'm instructing must love one another. If you begin
   to run this race and jostle against on another, knock one another off balance, he said he’ll have to
   disqualify you from the race." Is that by the understanding? All runners must love one another.
   "Now, if one of the runners he said, breaks out in such a tremendous speed because of the true
   manna that he's been eating, he got so energized. Is that right! He got so stimulated by revelation
   and he broke out and just run off and left everybody else, he said, don't let no jealousy rise up
   among you," He said. "Just give praises and glory to God. Don't be jealous." Just give praises to
   God. Is that right? That's all.
   Boy, I tell you a runner one time that had been training, he sure had a trainer. He told
   Ahab, he said, "I hear the sound of abundance of rain." He said, "Get you down and he hadn't
   eaten in about forty days, I believe it was and he took off a running and outran all the chariots
   and horses in the town. Brother, I tell you, he sure was eating something, wasn't he? The ravens
   had been feeding him I guess, some of that hidden manna. Is that right!
   Now he said, "You runners, every one of you have to die out to yourself. Now he said, if
   you’re gonna try to come on this course and say, 'Oh my, I know all about running, why, I used
   to run track back there, said my, look here you got to get down this way and spring up this way
   on the balls of your feet.” Now listen, that self-righteousness isn't going to work. If you’re
   gonna run this race you’re gonna have to lay aside every bit of them ole filthy rags of
   righteousness you got and take on the righteousness of the Holy Ghost. Can you say, amen?
   Praise the Lord Jesus Christ. And if you think you know something, you don't know
   anything. You only know one thing, Jesus Christ and Him crucified. I don't know any man after
   the flesh. I just know Jesus Christ that's the Spirit of God, Brother Anthony. Is that right!
   All right, he said, "Let me tell you something, runners. I want you to understand this.
   Now you are all just one big athletic group he said. Now he said, if I catch a one of you talking
   about the other runner he said, I'm gonna disqualify you." For He said, " He that thinketh himself
   to be a runner, a runner and bridleth not his tongue, he said, he’s running in vain. You are a vain
   runner! Unless you bridle your tongue, you’re a vain runner and you are disqualified and barred
   from contending in this race. Boy, I lose qualification on that. I hope nobody got disqualified
   yet. Is that right!
   Now Paul said, in First Corinthians 9:24, that we just read:
   Corinthians 9:24
    Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So
   run, that ye may obtain.
   Now, do you remember the lesson that we had this morning? Do you see how this lesson
   tonight fits in? We showed you by the word of God this morning that, that king, evil nature, that
   was sitting upon the throne of your heart is a dethroned monarch. His power, evil power, has
   been severed by the Lord Jesus Christ and you have both the will power and the spirit and the
   energy to be a runner for Jesus Christ. He has more than enabled you to be a runner. Is that right?
   So then, let us set our faces as flint towards this crown of righteousness which we will receive at
   8
   the day of the Lord's coming and all the rewards. Let us make up our minds today that we have
   severed that evil nature from us.
   We are not going to put that belt back on that wheel up there. Remember that. Excuse me,
   it's going to stay disconnected now and forever. Is that right! And our lives are going to be
   motivated by that inward power of the Holy Spirit. We are no more going to move and talk and
   have our being in the power and strength of the carnal man, the evil nature. But by the Spirit and
   by the word of God we will overcome this evil nature and enter into this course, this hard course,
   and run this race with patience that we might be able to obtain this precious crown of
   righteousness which Jesus will give us at His appearing. Is that right!
   Now there is a hindrance to a runner, hindrances to a runner. Galatians 5:7 said:
   Galatians 5:7
   You did run well but who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth?
   Now, there is no getting around this, Friend. It's a hindrance to you if you are not going to
   obey the Truth. If the Bible said do such and such, then just do it. If you don't it, it will be a
   hindrance to your running. You will be disqualified and thereby not be able to contend in this
   race. You must obey the word of God. Is that right!
   Now, let us speak of “pressing” a minute. You’ve got to press into this race. Now listen,
   we don't have long to run. The course is getting rougher that's true. Just before the finish line the
   battle does get greater, doesn't it? It takes an extra burst of energy. You have to have more
   energy towards the end of the race. The whole crown depends on whether or not you have energy
   stored up. And I tell you tonight that you will be able to store up energy if you’ll have a prayer
   life. Is that right? Paul said, "Pray that you might find strength or grace in the hour of need to
   finish over that finish line. We need to be praying at all times that we might have the strength
   that we need. Is that right! For that extra burst of energy and God has given us more word,
   continually more manna that we might be able to get this strength. Is that right!
   We can't say to God that He isn't giving us enough hidden manna, enough strength, is that
   right, enough Spirit to give us strength cause he is. Is that right! Now, he said, "I press toward the
   mark for the prize of the high calling in Christ Jesus." Now “pressing,” that's a great thing. When
   you start pressing something, that means pressure. Is that right! You begin to apply pressure and
   what we need to do, we need to begin to apply pressure to this evil nature, to press it down and
   make it stay down Is that right? That we might be able to get this extra burst of energy that we
   need to just put us over the finishing line. We are in the finishing close of this race. How many
   believe it?
   Let me tell ya, fifty percent of all the people in the street believe that the Lord Jesus
   Christ, the King of Kings, is coming back to earth very soon. Did you know that? Fifty percent
   of these ungodly people in the streets of New York City believe in a literal coming of the Lord
   Jesus Christ back to earth. Why? Because they seen that everything is at an end. Food production
   is at its end almost; cattle raising is at its end; medical profession is at its end; marriage is at its
   end; the armies are at its end; everything is at its end. And the earth couldn't go on another
   twenty-five years because it took six thousand years to get one billion people upon the earth,
   then in just another hundred years they were able to get two more billion, in just a hundred years,
   and it took six thousand years to get one billion.
   9
   Now if it goes on at this rate of speed, within another twenty-fire years, you wouldn't
   have no place to stand hardly there would be so many people. So, the people are desperate, the
   governments are desperate to know what to do. They are perplexed by the things which are
   happening. So that should energize… Is that right! It should energize you and I into pressing this
   battle more than ever to know that this crown of righteousness is just at the door. Don't cry any
   more it's all over now, and you did run well.
   Oh, how terrible it will be to hear, "Depart from me ye worker of iniquity, I know you
   not." And a worker of iniquity is to know to do good and do it not. He that knoweth to do good
   and doeth it not, to him it is sin. How wonderful and precious it will be to lay down this life that
   we’re living now and to feel an arm slip in your arm. There’ll stand your Savior, comforting you
   and loving you and saying nice things; how I love you, I welcome you home. Here is your new
   mansion. Amen. I tell you Friend, that's worth running this race for. It may be a hard course the
   restrictions may be hard. Is that right! But I tell you, it's worth running. Amen? I think any one of
   us should be more than thrilled to be able to enter upon this course of life that we’re running.
   Now stripping for the contest, Hebrews 12:1 says:
   Hebrews 12:1
   Wherefore seeing we are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses,
   let us lay aside every weight and the sinful nature, (Amen?) which doth so easily
   beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us
   How are you going to run the race? Lay aside this sinful nature. Just say, "Here it is Lord,
   Here lays my sinful nature. My God, let it be dead, kill it and let me enter onto this course and
   run this race." Many have gotten confused and bewildered in trying to run this race. They started
   out, they thought they received the Baptism of the Holy Spirit, they thought they were baptized
   right in water. They thought they received everything right according to the Bible and then they
   entered on to this course and because of what they saw with their eyes or what they heard with
   their ears they began to want to get off the course. They found out the mile and a half was just
   too much for them to run. They wanted to get a shorter, easier course. They wanted to go back
   into the weaker beggar elements of the world.
   They said, "Oh, it's not too bad to watch television and I don't think it hurts to go to this
   and to go to that. I don't think it hurts to cut my hair. And they begin to want a, get an easier
   course to run and the first thing you know they got backslidden. They went to this church and
   they went to that church looking for something that would help them to be able them to run a
   better race and they got confused. They saw this person speaking in tongues and saw that they
   went out and married somebody else. They saw this one speak in tongues and then seen that they
   were the meanest person that there ever was. They said, "Oh, this race is terrible." And the next
   thing you know, they got discouraged. They got discouraged and stopped training to be an
   athlete, a Christian.
   We don't need to look at anything. The only one thing that we need to look at is the word
   of God. I tell you, the word of God will deliver you from everything that you saw and everything
   that you have heard. It will deliver you…?... God said…?...
   The Baptism of the Holy Spirit and He said, "Though you speak with tongues of men and
   angels and have not love, charity, you are nothing." That confuses people. They speak in tongues
   10
   and think the race is completed. You may not even have gotten started yet. You may have just
   got blessed of the Lord and spoke in tongues then again you might have went into an assembly
   that's polluted with devils and the devil rested upon you and you spoke in false tongues because
   down in the desert we find out, Brother Joe, that the Indians down there drank blood out of a
   skull and speak in tongues and gave the interpretation.
   And yet the Pentecostal church trying to get their people to enter on this race based their
   whole experience upon speaking in tongues. So therefore, they've been shipwrecked on the race
   course. They stumbled and fell over a stone and broke their necks. Now it's a bunch of spiritual
   broken-necked people. Can you say, amen? Can you say amen! They are spiritually broken
   down. Is that right! They have run themselves out until that they are at the end of their road but
   they need to get their qualification straightened up. Jesus said, "Repent and be baptized in the
   Name of the Lord Jesus Christ and then you shall receive the Power to run that race." Is that
   right! Then He said, "You'll speak in tongues, you'll prophesy, you'll heal the sick and you'll
   raise the dead." But some want to run the race without getting the qualification. You can't even
   get on the course.
   Isaiah said there was one course to run. He said that was the “broad way.” But he said
   there was another course that was called “a way.” There are restrictions on that way. And on the
   other race course, in the Gospels we find that he said that there was broad race course and he said
   that there was many runners on that race course, many runners on it. Is that right? But he said, at
   the end of it was destruction. But he said on this narrow race course there wasn't many running
   because they didn't want to abide by the restrictions. They didn't want to get baptized in the
   Name of the Lord Jesus Christ because everybody said that was “Jesus Only.” So therefore, they
   got a false baptism. They just worked them up and worked themselves up and up until they
   finally spoke in some kind of words that wasn't their English and somebody said," You got
   it. That's the Holy Ghost." And then you found out that there are things in your life that condemn
   you.
   People who claim to have the Holy Ghost are living in free love and everything else out
   here. You are not even on the race course of Jesus Christ. You are disqualified. Brother, this race
   course is a race of holiness. It’s a race of righteousness. They’re disqualified, Brother Anthony.
   There's qualifications to get on this race course, and it said, “Narrow is the way,” said it
   was pressed and that word “press” means contracted by pressure. Brother, when you get this
   Truth, the same Truth that the apostles were preaching, Brother, there begins to be
   pressure. Brother, every demon in hell, begins trying to pressure you to get you to leave the race
   course. But the Holy Spirit, the Instructor will not let us leave the race course. He is more than
   able to keep us. I don't worry about backsliding. He'll put His arm around me. Of course, I
   backslide little bit every day, probably, but I need to press forward. Is that right? I need to press
   “toward.” Amen.
   I'm so thankful for the Holy Spirit. One man, when I began to tell him and come against
   those doctrines that he believed, by the Word of God, it condemned him and tore them down
   because he had no answer. You got no answer for speaking in tongues is the initial evidence of
   the Holy Ghost. There's no Bible for it and the Word of God condemns it. But it's no use of just
   leaving the race course, Brother. Get the right qualifications and start all over again. For God
   said, "When the Holy Spirit is come, the Instructor, he'll lead you and guide you onto this race
   course. He'll lead you and guide you all through this course, though Satan would plant all kind
   of snares and holes in the way." He said, he would lead you around those holes. He would lead
   11
   you out of those snares, Brother, Ray. The Holy Spirit, the Holy Ghost is here. He's faithful and
   He's able to deliver you. Notice, the Bible said that the Holy Spirit, Jesus Christ was more than
   able to make that brother stand. God, the Holy Ghost, will make that brother stand. He said, "I
   thank Thee Father, all that Thou hast given me shall come to me and him that cometh to me I
   will in no wise cast out. All that Thou hast given me I've lost not a one of them on this race
   course."
   I'm here to tell you tonight that every believer of the Lord Jesus Christ will win this
   race. God is going to have a Bride. God is going to have some spiritual runners to run this race.
   Listen, we are heading into the home stretch now. Israel is in its homeland. Oh, we see the line
   right ahead. If you see a white ribbon in it, Joe, your eyes catch a hold of that white ribbon. You
   said… Oh the Bible said, "When you see these signs taking place, when you see earthquakes in
   divers places, when you see famines,” He said, “when you see marrying and giving in marriage
   and drinking and reviling and all these things," He said, "Look up, the race is almost
   finished." We can see the ribbon in sight. We can see it in sight. God is in a prophet; the Pillar of
   Fire is in our midst. The Pillar of Fire is in our midst. “False prophets are lying, God's truth
   they’re denying.” We have the Gospel right in our midst…?...
   Glory to God! We got it. We got the “proof of the pudding.” We need the pudding and
   that’s the proof. Is that right? Israel is in its homeland. “False prophets are lying God's Truth
   they’re denying.” Why? God said, "You don't have the Word of God abiding in you because
   whom God hath sent, Him you receiveth not and that proves you don't have the Word of God. I
   know why you don't have the Word of God in you because you love the praises of men more
   than you love God…?... You don't want to run this course that I want you to run. You want to
   receive a lot of popularity."
   Disqualified. You need to get the qualification. I tell you Peter, Peter certainly had the
   qualification. When three thousand souls cried out one day, when they seen a man that was so or
   who had been eating the hidden manna that was so great that he was just absolutely drunk from
   it. Is that right! He just staggered out of there from that hidden manna. Is that right? Because he'd
   often wondered about what the hidden manna was. But when his Master, Jesus, the first great
   Runner said, "Except you eat My Flesh and drink My Blood you can't even run this race," that
   almost stumbled, Peter. But he said, "Lord, I can't go anywhere." He said, "I don’t know where I
   could go. I'll just have to wait on this thought about your flesh."
   I tell you, when that sound came that day, Peter found out what that Flesh and Blood
   was. He hollered, “More Blood, Lord.” And he began to guzzle, guzzle, guzzle, guzzle and,
   when he staggered down out of the upper room, three thousand runners cried out. They had been
   running but they were disqualified because what came down out of the upper room, gave them a
   disqualification. Is that right! Oh boy, they lost their rules then and they were pricked in their
   heart because they found out that they were disqualified. They were disqualified. They failed to
   go and eat of the hidden Manna. Failed to eat that hidden Manna and drink that Blood. So, they
   were pricked in their heart and said, "Oh Mr. Runner, Peter, what in the world are we going to
   do? How in the world can we enter this race?"
   He said, "Boy, don't live under the law. You can't run that race under the law. You can't
   run this race you don't have enough strength. Get what I just got up there and you'll be able to
   run because He said, "I shall give you Power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you." Do
   you want to receive power? Do you want to receive power? Then Peter said, "Repent every one
   12
   of you runners and be baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ, then you shall receive power to run
   this race. You shall receive power."
   He promised us power if we would be baptized in Jesus’ Name. How many want that
   Power to run this race, tonight? Then stand to your feet and let's receive this power tonight. Do
   you want to run a race that will be fitting to Jesus Christ? Stand to your feet. How many say,
   amen. Let's raise our hands and praise God for the power. Amen. Hallelujah!
   Oh Lord, send the Power just now and baptize every one. Would you not like to have
   God that created the heavens and the earth to come down and tabernacle himself inside of you
   tonight? Lovely Lord Jesus. Hallelujah, Amen. (Much praising the Lord by congregation)
   Let's all keep our minds on the Lord. Look straight up. Raise your hands to heaven and
   worship the Lord. Keep your minds on Him. Worship Jesus. Jesus, we love You, Lord. We
   praise You. We thank You, Lord, for blessing this people, God. We thank You, Holy Spirit for
   being in our midst, Lord. Bless everyone, Father God.
   Amen. We thank you, Lord Jesus, for blessing us, Father God. Father God, speak to our
   hearts. Father God, give us the interpretation, in Jesus' name. Amen. It needs an interpreter,
   Lord. Father, we pray that You will give us the interpretation, Lord. We ask it humbly, in Jesus'
   name, Amen. Congregation praises the Lord. A lapse in the tape
   The way to receive the blessing of the Lord is to make love to the Lord. As we begin to
   sing this song. Listen to Brother Bob, now. you just meditate upon how wonderful Jesus is to
   you. How much you thank Him and praise Him for His dying for you. And as you make love to
   the Lord Jesus and then sing to Him and your heart, begins to make love to Him then that brings
   a contact with His Spirit and yours. Then he’ll pour out his spirit upon you and baptize you with
   the holy ghost and confirm your faith in Him. Amen?
   How many know this little song…?... “Jesus Is The Sweetest Name I Know?” Isn't He
   the sweetest Name you know? Is there one here tonight that may not be in perfect fellowship
   with the Lord Jesus? As we sing this song we pray that the Lord Jesus will bless you and that you
   may know him again in the first love that you had for him. May each one of you out there tonight
   and myself, return if we have ever left our first love in Jesus.
   Soon this heaven or this earth world order, the fashion of this world and its order. It’s
   different languages and its different modes of life, whether you live in the top of so and so
   building or in the basement, whether you speak in German or you speak in English or French,
   that life is soon to pass away and Jesus, the one who we love, is coming back to set up his
   kingdom. So, if you don't know Jesus, I'd like to tell you that He loves you tonight. He loves you
   because he died for you and because he died for you He has given you a covenant and that
   covenant is, “He that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting
   life.” If you don't have everlasting life tonight, we pray that you will find it as you sit in your seat
   if you don't have the Infilling of the Holy Spirit, the Seal of God. Open up your heart and let
   Jesus come and sit upon your throne and be King and Master over your life. Is that right?
   Let us sing this song now. “Jesus Is the Sweetest Name I Know.” Congregation sings.
   Lord, say something to us. Amen. The Lord Jesus has spoken to us in a language that we
   wouldn't understand. We are just all babies so we pray that the Lord would be merciful to us and
   give us the interpretation. You that are gifted, would you pray in your heart. Let us pray.
   Yes, let us praise God, to give Him all praise.
   13
   Number forty-four in the song book. One time I believe it was when they were in the
   presence of the great revival and when the Holy Spirit would come down and strike the people
   some would immediately fall onto the floor and shake and cry and weep and wail and do all
   manner of things and then some of those that would be standing by who was not spiritual would
   think, “Lord maybe this is some kind of an evil spirit or something.” And they said unto John,
   said, "Mr., Dr. Wesley, why, aren't you afraid that this is some kind of a spiritual fanaticism
   or…?" He said "Relax, relax friend and let the Lord have His way."
   The Bible said, "They that worship me, me Jesus, must worship in truth and in
   spirit." Remember that we worship in truth and he, the holy spirit, is here. I would like for those
   who are more grown up in the Lord who has had training, spiritual training to kind of refrain
   from maybe stomping your feet up and down. If the Holy Spirit would fall again when we sing
   this song it would be pleasing to the Lord if we could worship him as calm as we could. I mean
   those who are not under a tremendous power of the holy spirit would not, course all of us at
   times are unable to contain the blessing of the Lord but those that are weak in the Lord when the
   holy spirit would strike them in a sharp anointing that they can feel, naturally they would start to
   scream. So that the rest of us that are growing up. Let us go on worshiping the Lord making love
   to Jesus that he may fall on someone else. Amen.
   So, let our minds drop to another… of anything else beside worshiping the Lord. Now
   how many today… the message that we heard this morning that the Lord has given and the one
   tonight… Do you see how they fit together? How many love this assembly with all of your
   heart? How many love one another with all of your heart? How many desire to see the Lord
   Jesus? I mean a literal river of God flow through here and flood our souls with the power and the
   love of God. Could we do this tonight? Cause I believe maybe Wednesday if the Brethren would
   have me to speak, however it works out. I feel like today, tonight that it would behoove us,
   seeing that the ribbon… We see the finishing line and the white ribbon just ahead. As we
   said, Israel is in its homeland.
   The Spirit of the Gentile’s door is closing. The wrath of God and the judgment of God is
   getting ready to be poured out. How many would today that would say with brother Bob, not out
   loud but by the raising of your hands, “I am tired of obeying the dictates of the sinful man and I
   have talked about my brother and I haven't been faithful in many ways in respect. But I would
   like this day to be able to enter onto this race course though it's almost finished now. But I would
   like to be faithful to this assembly and to my minister. I would like to be faithful to my brothers
   and sisters, never to speak evil of them but only to do good and that I might, above all things,
   speak well of my brothers and sisters that I might edify them, that my whole purpose in life
   might be, Oh God, is there someone today that I could be a blessing to. Is there someone that is
   hungry that I could feed? Is there some brother or sister that doesn't have a coat that I could share
   mine with?
   Is it possible that you could fast a meal, for your assembly, for your ministers? Could you
   pray more? Amen. How many, after today that heard this message, this morning and the one
   tonight would like to enter into this race seeing that the finish line is just ahead and you would
   like to rededicate your life to the Lord Jesus tonight and to this assembly and how many with an
   up raising of hands and say I would like to be in subjection to my brother and sister? How many
   would like to do that? And I would like to prefer my brother and sister above myself? I think
   Jesus would be very pleased, don't you?
   14
   So, as we sing this dedication song, “What A Friend We Have In Jesus.” Let us take that
   to our heart that we would come back to service Wednesday night with a new determination and
   a greater effort to live this Christian life so that the others may see Jesus in you and me. Amen.
   Congregation sings, “What A Friend.”
   Brother George Parylla, would you dismiss us in prayer?

   Let us remain standing. And if you’ll bow your heads with me in a word of prayer to the Lord.
   Opening Prayer: by Robert Lambert
   Almighty God that did create the heavens and the earth by thy precious word, has by thy
   word in these last days given us a Restoration of the true Apostolic Doctrine of which we are so
   grateful that we are able to sing this song that we sang tonight, “Onward Christian Soldiers,” one
   faith and one doctrine and one Lord and one baptism. We thank You for these things, Father, for
   through them, Lord, we are able to have fellowship one with another without splitting and
   differences but we are able to love one another because these doctrines have brought us a
   persecution, Lord, and have driven us together that we may be one as you have spoken of in your
   word. Of these things we are very grateful to you, Father God.
   And we pray tonight, Father, that you will come and bless us because we love thee and
   we desire to have you in our presence so very much Lord. We give praises unto thee that you
   come down and bless us. So, Father, we have no differences with one another, Lord. I don't
   know of anyone here tonight that doesn't love me. I don't know anyone here, Lord, that I don't
   love. So, Father, I pray, God, that if there is anyone here tonight that would have an ought in
   their heart against their brother, please, Lord Jesus, may they make it right tonight that we might
   be able to climb up a little higher with thee, Father, that you might be able, Lord, to bless us in a
   greater way.
   Remember thy servant and thy messenger tonight and, Father, we pray that thou will
   comfort and bless him, that thou will continually bless his ministry in a tremendous way,
   Lord. Stop up the mouth of the gainsayers and let the word of God go forth with power that
   cometh down on Mount Sinai that would cause the disbelievers to wonder, Lord. Now, Father,
   bless me and help me, Lord. And, Lord, have mercy upon me, Father, and forgive me of my
   sins. Cover them in the Blood of Jesus Christ. May you only hear my voice tonight and not see
   me, Lord, and, Lord, come and minister to us the word of God. In Jesus Christ's
   Name. Amen. You may be seated.
   Jesus is wonderful. Jesus, well he's just Jesus. If you never met him, you need to. I'm
   telling you I'm just so happy I don't know what to do. I hate New York City but I sure do love
   this assembly. I believe it's worth living in Sodom to be able to come here. I'm quite sure, if
   some of the other members of the Bride knew how the golden Oil of the Holy Spirit was being so
   lavishly poured out in our midst, they would be contemplating moving here to Sodom, even if
   the area is unclean. God is able to sanctify it. If the Pope was able to throw some kind of stuff
   into that old nasty Mississippi River and call it holy…. It's the dirtiest river I know of with all
   the other rivers and the sewers emptying into it. He was able to sanctify it and make it clean. God
   ought to be able, through the prayer of the saints, to sanctify the place. Amen?
   
   2
   Well, to those who would be in our midst tonight, who might be strangers to us. First we
   would like to welcome you here to the Local Christian Assembly. We don't have no strange
   doctrines. The only doctrines that we have are Bible doctrines. They are old doctrines and they
   have been handed down to us from our apostolic father, Brother Peter, to Brother Bob.
   We would like to say that none of these doctrines have been handed to us through any
   school or college or any denomination. We have no creed but Christ and we have no other things
   to give you other than the word of God. We have no great choir but our saints do love to sing the
   songs of Zion. Amen?
   We'd like to give you a hearty welcome tonight. We would like to tell you if you don't
   know now; if you’ll look around and look at the people, they’re full of love and we love all and
   we'll be very happy for you if you don't have a church home to make this your church home.
   Incidentally, if you’re wondering tonight who I am, I'm just another little minister here
   and this is my home assembly. I live several hundred miles away and it's difficult to get here
   every meeting. However, I wish the Lord could so arrange it that it could be. Amen?
   Are you happy? Do you love the Lord Jesus? Would you think about maybe trading the
   Lord Jesus for something in the world, maybe? Do you know anything? There’s nothing is it? No
   wonder Solomon cried, brothers, "All is vanity." He said he tried everything and all of it was
   vanity. Well, the greatest thing we have in common tonight would be that we love the Lord
   Jesus.
   Now if you say that you love the Lord Jesus and you don't obey his word then, well, we
   don't know about that. Is that right! So, because we love the Lord Jesus we want to look into his
   word tonight to see if he will enable us to be better Christians. Now if you’ll kindly open your
   Bibles to I Corinthians 9:24. Read’s like this.
   After the lesson that we had this morning and I would like to see your hands if you
   believe that God had something in that message this morning that will enable you to be a better
   soldier for this Lord Jesus Christ that we love and for your precious Local Christian Assembly. If
   you believe that message has helped you and that enabled you to find out more about yourself
   and more about how you will be able to be an overcomer, let's see your hand. You are wanting to
   go up into a higher level with the Lord Jesus. You’ll be able to do that by looking at the word of
   God and making adjustment in our daily experience, our daily walk. We will be able to move
   into a higher plane with the Lord Jesus and only this way. Just prayer and just coming to service
   will not move you into a higher plane but you must….
   I think we all have a sound intelligent mind and through this mind that the Lord has given
   us, he said to make it intelligent as possibly we can. Though you may be dumb according to the
   world but yet you can be intelligent in the things of God. And since we have this mind then we
   want to adjust it in such a fashion with the word of God that we might be able to know what we
   are fighting and how we are able to overcome our opponents and how that we’ll be able to please
   the Lord Jesus. We can only do this by coming to service, by loving one another, by the word of
   God and obeying the word of God and putting into practice what we have learned up here. Let us
   read now. I Corinthians 9:24-27
   The subject that I will like to teach on tonight is, “A Spiritual Race, the Spiritual
   Athlete.”
   
   3
   I Corinthians 9:24-27
   (24) Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth
   the prize? So run, that ye may obtain.
   (25) And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all
   things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible.
   (26) I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that
   beateth the air;
   (27 )But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by
   any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.
   I'd like to talk on that word, “castaway.” It's such a wonderful word. But however, I
   would just go on because there are so many good things in there to talk about. Now, as I said
   before, we would like to speak on, “A Spiritual Race” and I'd like for you to tune your mind into
   making a picture in front of you of an athlete that is training to run track, what we call here
   in America, “run track.” Incidentally, I preached on this before but I thought maybe if God
   would bless it I would preach it again to you. Joe was an athlete, a runner. He ran track so he’ll
   be able to understand this very well and I hope that you will also.
   Now Paul is saying here to you… Let us go ahead and read Timothy while I'm at it, the
   Second book of Timothy, Second Timothy, second chapter, and if you would look in the fifth
   verse only. Right now, if you would just look at the fifth verse:
   2 Timothy 2:5
   And if a man also strive for masteries, yet He is not crowned, except he
   strive lawfully.
   Same words that he was speaking about over there, talking about a mastery, a mastery
   and striving. Now, I'd like to call your attention to why Paul was talking about an athlete here to
   Timothy. In the first place, Paul was living in an age of great athletes. They had the great
   Olympic games, as they would call them, and everybody was athletic minded. All their attention
   and all of their energy was put upon the outward man to make it big and muscular and
   strong. They beat one another to death in these games and so their whole life was centered
   around how strong those men, could make their bodies.
   Paul was trying to put a point over here to Timothy. That’s why that he was able to speak
   on this manner. If you’ll notice here that, first, Paul was talking up here in the other part of the
   Scriptures about a soldier and Paul said the words, “soldier of Jesus Christ.” Paul said he would
   liken that unto the Roman Legionnaires who were in the service of their emperor. Paul said to
   Timothy, "Timothy, endure hardship like these Roman Legionnaires. Timothy, I want you to be
   able to endure these hardships of the gospel with me, but Timothy if you see these Legionnaires,
   Roman Legionnaires who are holding the Jews in captivity and in prison, he said, if they’re able
   to endure all these hardships just for their Roman Emperor, how much more should you
   Timothy, since He's called you as a young soldier into the army of the Lord Jesus Christ and He
   is the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords, how much more should you be able to endure
   hardships? If these Roman Legionnaires can do this, Timothy, how much more should you be
   
   4
   able to do it?" Then he went on to say, "Timothy, no man that warreth entangles himself with the
   affairs of this life that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier."
   In other words, he said, "Timothy, forget about everything else, that you've had, anything
   to do with in this other life that you were living and lay everything aside and don't entangle
   yourself with nothing but the supreme thought of being a good soldier for Jesus Christ."
   Now this Word, “warreth” means to make a military expedition. It means to do military
   duty, be on active service to be engaged in a continual warfare. Now, you and I in order to run
   this race must realize that we are soldiers for Jesus Christ and that we are on a military
   expedition of the Lord Jesus Christ and we are his ambassadors. And He has given us, as His
   ambassadors, everything that we need for this battle that we are fighting and for this race that we
   are running. He has furnished everything that we need to be able to be the soldier that we need to
   be. Is that understood? Now, as I said, from this figure of a soldier, this Roman Legionnaire that
   Paul was speaking to Timothy about, he turns immediately to these great Greek athletes, of
   which you see the statues in the museums and everything. Is that right! You see the books today
   of the men standing like this, well they got that from these great Greek athletes that fought in
   these tremendous coliseums, whatever they called them, where they beat one another to death
   and blood just flowed everywhere, great big biceps and everything. Paul turns to that of a soldier
   to Timothy and speaks of this Greek athlete and this is what we want to dwell on.
   Now this Greek athlete strived and struggled to build himself a great body to receive a
   crown, which they called a wreath, here Paul spoke of, to receive a crown, a wreath. This victor
   who was a victor of this race would win a wreath that would crown that would come down on his
   head and it was made of ivory, laurel and roses and all kind of little flowers and he won this
   crown. Brother Anthony, the only way that he could win it is that he went according to the
   prescribed rules that were laid down, that he strived lawfully. And the only way that you and I
   will ever be able to receive the crown of eternal Life and righteousness that God will give us in
   that day is that we strive lawfully.
   The only way that we can strive lawfully and that is to obey the word of God. You cannot
   break the rules of this game. For you to break the rules and not love your brother, you are
   disqualified. You are annulled from even entering into this race. That's why Paul said, "Though
   that I may have preached to you I fear that lest myself would be a castaway." Paul didn't mean
   castaway from eternal life—he had eternal life, but Paul meant that he might be a castaway, that
   he might be disqualified, in other words, of running this race of patience that was set before him
   that he might be conformed into the Image of the son of Jesus Christ. That was Paul's race that
   he was running, that he might be conformed and molded and made into a real Son of God
   like.... And Paul said that God had chosen him to show forth the Son of God in him first.
   Paul was the first one to be able to run this race and by the Grace of God he won it. He
   set his face out to win that race and he did win it. Is, that right? Paul said, "Timothy, think about
   it, though you may give your whole life to the Lord Jesus Christ, lay down everything in the
   world, you're going to win more than they are Timothy. The best that they could win is the
   praises of man and a little wreath upon their head with a few roses in it. But Timothy, you will
   receive a crown of righteousness which the Lord Jesus Christ will give you in that day, an
   incorruptible crown. That crown that those athletes won that they strived so hard and sweated
   and beat themselves for ten months of training, the best that they won was a wreath."
   Brother, we win an everlasting crown of righteousness which shall never pass
   away. Glory to God! I tell you, that's worth running for. Can you say, Amen?
   
   5
   Paul said, "Think of that Timothy!” This Greek athlete had to train ten months of
   preparatory training before he was even allowed to get on the track for running. He trained hard
   for ten months and if he was to break any one of these regulations, he had to completely separate
   himself from everything in his life and set his face like a flint to win that crown that laurel
   wreath crown made up of roses. And he was placed on a rigid diet. And as I said, should he
   break the training rules he was disqualified immediately and barred from even engaging in the
   athletic contest.
   I want to tell you something tonight: You are absolutely disqualified to even run this race
   if you are not baptized the right way. Unless you have been baptized in the Name of the Lord
   Jesus Christ, you cannot enter into this race. Now that's one rule you are going to have to abide
   by if you are going to run this race. Is that right, brother? Now, we saw what the Greek athlete
   was like, what kind of a race was he running. Now I showed you why Paul spoke to Timothy that
   way about a Greek athlete. Now, we will turn it over. I think you got a good spiritual
   understanding of that now. Now, we find here that there is a hindrance to a runner. Is that
   true? Let me go back and start over here though.
   Now, we have certain qualifications that you and I must meet in order to begin this race. I
   think the first thing that you need to do to be able to run this race is to believe on the Lord Jesus
   Christ as your personal Savior, then you should be baptized in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ
   for the remission of your sins. Then I think that you should undoubtedly be baptized with the
   Baptism of the Holy Spirit, then that qualifies you to enter into this preparatory training to win
   this crown—not a corruptible crown but a crown of righteousness which the Lord Jesus Christ
   will give you when you finish the race. True. True? Now, since you and I have never run this
   spiritual race before… I never have. Have you?
   All right. Since we have never run a spiritual race before, God has given us an Instructor,
   the Holy Ghost. Now, He has trained great champions such as Jesus Christ, such as the great
   apostle Paul. What a race Paul ran. What a race for you and I. He has trained such great athletes
   as Mary Magdalene, the Virgin Mary. He has trained such great men as Philip, the evangelist. He
   has had plenty of training and the Holy Spirit is more than qualified to be able to teach you and I
   how to run this race. A great trainer.
   Now, this course that we are to run over is a very hard course. It's filled with all kinds of
   sticks and stones that like to break your bones, plenty of words that want to hurt you. It's filled
   with all kinds of holes and snares. Satan said he set a snare, too. It has plenty of holes and plenty
   of snares, plenty of tribulation.
   It's raining, sometimes you will be running this race and it will be raining. It will
   thundering. It will be lighting. Is that right? Sometimes you'll be running and you won't have
   hardly nothing to eat. You may be stuck off in a corner where there is no assembly, yet you have
   to run right on anyway. Though you may have a hurt here down here inside of you, one leg may
   be hurting but you'll have to run anyway. Listen this is really some race that we are running. It's a
   hard course and we are not just running a mile and a quarter. We’re running until death separates
   us from this body and we go to be with the Lord. We’re not just running a half a mile or two
   miles or three miles but we are going to run this race every day, twenty-four hours a day we have
   to run this race until we lay down our lives... the Lord Jesus Christ.
   We are not to complain about the conditions of this course over which we are to run. But
   we are to give praises and thanksgiving to God for every stone, for every hole, for every snare
   which the Holy Spirit will have you to run. We cannot be backbiting and complaining in any
   
   6
   fashion because the Holy Spirit, our Instructor, has told us that these things would be. He said,
   "If they made fun of that first athlete, Jesus Christ, where they called Him the master of the
   house of Beelzebub, how much more will they call you that?
   "If they would have received your words," He said, "They would have received
   Mine." But He said, "When you are running this race and they begin to talk about you and they
   begin to persecute you," He said, "Blessed are ye for running this race. Blessed are you. Just
   keep running." If the women while they are running this race begin to let their hair grow long
   and beautiful, begin to wear their dresses to cover their knees…"
   Boy I tell you, if it's anything today to see a woman trying to run her race, brother, with
   no material on, trying to get down like that and pull that dress and trying to stretch that material
   down over her knees. I tell you tonight you’re disqualified from the race if you don't get some
   more material on. Is that right? You know, if you cut off your hair, you are going to be
   disqualified from this race. If the women are not in subjection to their husband I think they
   should be disqualified, brother. Amen? And I think the Holy Spirit, the Instructor, will see to it
   that that's done.
   Now the Holy Spirit, our Instructor in this spiritual race, has given us a very strict diet to
   go on. Now He has told us He does not want us to eat any bread that's cankered. He said,
   "Because if you eat this old cankered doctrine it will make you sick. Therefore, you'll not be able
   to train tomorrow. You won’t feel like running track. Now, I tell ya an athlete just don't feel like
   running if the bread that he has been eating doesn't have anything in it. The bread that these
   churches are trying to feed God's athletes just doesn't have enough vitamins and minerals in it
   that enables them to be able to be a healthy runner. I tell you, but, if you’ll ever eat of that hidden
   manna it puts something down in you that helps you want to run... Glory to God,
   Hallelujah! Am... You will be so full of …?.. to hold you back. (Much shouting and praising
   God.) Is, that right?
   God said, "My runners get hungry," and he said, "I promise to feed every one of them
   that hidden manna." I tell you we don't want no germs… One of those big great athlete that's
   been trained by the great Holy Ghost, one of those great big runners said, "Why is it all tables are
   full of vomit?" The old Isaiah, that great runner said, "All tables are full of vomit. Why an
   athlete can't even get nothing to eat to be able to run around here." Is that right? Why one of
   these great athletes, the great Apostle Jude, I believe it was, why, he said, "It was terrible this
   vomit they was trying to feed us athletes. How can we train on such a diet?" Well, the Holy
   Spirit is saying to us, since we are running this race, he has put the bread there for us and He has
   given us strict orders: “Don't you dare eat nothing else but this true Bread that came down from
   heaven. Don't you dare because it will get you all cankered up and you won't be able to run."
   Now He said, "Runners," the Holy Spirit said, "In order to run tomorrow you are going to
   have to have a strong prayer life. That's the main thing." He said, "Because the first runner I
   trained was Jesus." And He said, "After He had run all day long, he had healed the sick, he
   opened the blinded eyes, He had fed the multitudes," He said, "Instead of sleeping now this
   runner that I was training went out into a mountain and there He prayed all night long in prayer
   to be able to run the next day." Is, that right? A strong prayer life is needed to be able to run this
   race.
   Now this great Instructor, the Holy Spirit said, "Student Athletes, if you are going to be a
   great athlete and a faithful runner you’re going to have to overcome the things of the
   world. Make up your mind right now. When prayer meeting night comes, you are not going to be
   
   7
   able to stay home and watch television, if you are going to run this race." That's what’s the
   matter. It has disqualified a lot of people and they stay home and watch television, broke
   training. You can't make an athlete like that.
   Now He said, "All these runners that I'm instructing must love one another. If you begin
   to run this race and jostle against on another, knock one another off balance, he said he’ll have to
   disqualify you from the race." Is that by the understanding? All runners must love one another.
   "Now, if one of the runners he said, breaks out in such a tremendous speed because of the true
   manna that he's been eating, he got so energized. Is that right! He got so stimulated by revelation
   and he broke out and just run off and left everybody else, he said, don't let no jealousy rise up
   among you," He said. "Just give praises and glory to God. Don't be jealous." Just give praises to
   God. Is that right? That's all.
   Boy, I tell you a runner one time that had been training, he sure had a trainer. He told
   Ahab, he said, "I hear the sound of abundance of rain." He said, "Get you down and he hadn't
   eaten in about forty days, I believe it was and he took off a running and outran all the chariots
   and horses in the town. Brother, I tell you, he sure was eating something, wasn't he? The ravens
   had been feeding him I guess, some of that hidden manna. Is that right!
   Now he said, "You runners, every one of you have to die out to yourself. Now he said, if
   you’re gonna try to come on this course and say, 'Oh my, I know all about running, why, I used
   to run track back there, said my, look here you got to get down this way and spring up this way
   on the balls of your feet.” Now listen, that self-righteousness isn't going to work. If you’re
   gonna run this race you’re gonna have to lay aside every bit of them ole filthy rags of
   righteousness you got and take on the righteousness of the Holy Ghost. Can you say, amen?
   Praise the Lord Jesus Christ. And if you think you know something, you don't know
   anything. You only know one thing, Jesus Christ and Him crucified. I don't know any man after
   the flesh. I just know Jesus Christ that's the Spirit of God, Brother Anthony. Is that right!
   All right, he said, "Let me tell you something, runners. I want you to understand this.
   Now you are all just one big athletic group he said. Now he said, if I catch a one of you talking
   about the other runner he said, I'm gonna disqualify you." For He said, " He that thinketh himself
   to be a runner, a runner and bridleth not his tongue, he said, he’s running in vain. You are a vain
   runner! Unless you bridle your tongue, you’re a vain runner and you are disqualified and barred
   from contending in this race. Boy, I lose qualification on that. I hope nobody got disqualified
   yet. Is that right!
   Now Paul said, in First Corinthians 9:24, that we just read:
   Corinthians 9:24
    Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So
   run, that ye may obtain.
   Now, do you remember the lesson that we had this morning? Do you see how this lesson
   tonight fits in? We showed you by the word of God this morning that, that king, evil nature, that
   was sitting upon the throne of your heart is a dethroned monarch. His power, evil power, has
   been severed by the Lord Jesus Christ and you have both the will power and the spirit and the
   energy to be a runner for Jesus Christ. He has more than enabled you to be a runner. Is that right?
   So then, let us set our faces as flint towards this crown of righteousness which we will receive at
   
   8
   the day of the Lord's coming and all the rewards. Let us make up our minds today that we have
   severed that evil nature from us.
   We are not going to put that belt back on that wheel up there. Remember that. Excuse me,
   it's going to stay disconnected now and forever. Is that right! And our lives are going to be
   motivated by that inward power of the Holy Spirit. We are no more going to move and talk and
   have our being in the power and strength of the carnal man, the evil nature. But by the Spirit and
   by the word of God we will overcome this evil nature and enter into this course, this hard course,
   and run this race with patience that we might be able to obtain this precious crown of
   righteousness which Jesus will give us at His appearing. Is that right!
   Now there is a hindrance to a runner, hindrances to a runner. Galatians 5:7 said:
   Galatians 5:7
   You did run well but who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth?
   Now, there is no getting around this, Friend. It's a hindrance to you if you are not going to
   obey the Truth. If the Bible said do such and such, then just do it. If you don't it, it will be a
   hindrance to your running. You will be disqualified and thereby not be able to contend in this
   race. You must obey the word of God. Is that right!
   Now, let us speak of “pressing” a minute. You’ve got to press into this race. Now listen,
   we don't have long to run. The course is getting rougher that's true. Just before the finish line the
   battle does get greater, doesn't it? It takes an extra burst of energy. You have to have more
   energy towards the end of the race. The whole crown depends on whether or not you have energy
   stored up. And I tell you tonight that you will be able to store up energy if you’ll have a prayer
   life. Is that right? Paul said, "Pray that you might find strength or grace in the hour of need to
   finish over that finish line. We need to be praying at all times that we might have the strength
   that we need. Is that right! For that extra burst of energy and God has given us more word,
   continually more manna that we might be able to get this strength. Is that right!
   We can't say to God that He isn't giving us enough hidden manna, enough strength, is that
   right, enough Spirit to give us strength cause he is. Is that right! Now, he said, "I press toward the
   mark for the prize of the high calling in Christ Jesus." Now “pressing,” that's a great thing. When
   you start pressing something, that means pressure. Is that right! You begin to apply pressure and
   what we need to do, we need to begin to apply pressure to this evil nature, to press it down and
   make it stay down Is that right? That we might be able to get this extra burst of energy that we
   need to just put us over the finishing line. We are in the finishing close of this race. How many
   believe it?
   Let me tell ya, fifty percent of all the people in the street believe that the Lord Jesus
   Christ, the King of Kings, is coming back to earth very soon. Did you know that? Fifty percent
   of these ungodly people in the streets of New York City believe in a literal coming of the Lord
   Jesus Christ back to earth. Why? Because they seen that everything is at an end. Food production
   is at its end almost; cattle raising is at its end; medical profession is at its end; marriage is at its
   end; the armies are at its end; everything is at its end. And the earth couldn't go on another
   twenty-five years because it took six thousand years to get one billion people upon the earth,
   then in just another hundred years they were able to get two more billion, in just a hundred years,
   and it took six thousand years to get one billion.
   
   9
   Now if it goes on at this rate of speed, within another twenty-fire years, you wouldn't
   have no place to stand hardly there would be so many people. So, the people are desperate, the
   governments are desperate to know what to do. They are perplexed by the things which are
   happening. So that should energize… Is that right! It should energize you and I into pressing this
   battle more than ever to know that this crown of righteousness is just at the door. Don't cry any
   more it's all over now, and you did run well.
   Oh, how terrible it will be to hear, "Depart from me ye worker of iniquity, I know you
   not." And a worker of iniquity is to know to do good and do it not. He that knoweth to do good
   and doeth it not, to him it is sin. How wonderful and precious it will be to lay down this life that
   we’re living now and to feel an arm slip in your arm. There’ll stand your Savior, comforting you
   and loving you and saying nice things; how I love you, I welcome you home. Here is your new
   mansion. Amen. I tell you Friend, that's worth running this race for. It may be a hard course the
   restrictions may be hard. Is that right! But I tell you, it's worth running. Amen? I think any one of
   us should be more than thrilled to be able to enter upon this course of life that we’re running.
   Now stripping for the contest, Hebrews 12:1 says:
   Hebrews 12:1
   Wherefore seeing we are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses,
   let us lay aside every weight and the sinful nature, (Amen?) which doth so easily
   beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us
   How are you going to run the race? Lay aside this sinful nature. Just say, "Here it is Lord,
   Here lays my sinful nature. My God, let it be dead, kill it and let me enter onto this course and
   run this race." Many have gotten confused and bewildered in trying to run this race. They started
   out, they thought they received the Baptism of the Holy Spirit, they thought they were baptized
   right in water. They thought they received everything right according to the Bible and then they
   entered on to this course and because of what they saw with their eyes or what they heard with
   their ears they began to want to get off the course. They found out the mile and a half was just
   too much for them to run. They wanted to get a shorter, easier course. They wanted to go back
   into the weaker beggar elements of the world.
   They said, "Oh, it's not too bad to watch television and I don't think it hurts to go to this
   and to go to that. I don't think it hurts to cut my hair. And they begin to want a, get an easier
   course to run and the first thing you know they got backslidden. They went to this church and
   they went to that church looking for something that would help them to be able them to run a
   better race and they got confused. They saw this person speaking in tongues and saw that they
   went out and married somebody else. They saw this one speak in tongues and then seen that they
   were the meanest person that there ever was. They said, "Oh, this race is terrible." And the next
   thing you know, they got discouraged. They got discouraged and stopped training to be an
   athlete, a Christian.
   We don't need to look at anything. The only one thing that we need to look at is the word
   of God. I tell you, the word of God will deliver you from everything that you saw and everything
   that you have heard. It will deliver you…?... God said…?...
   The Baptism of the Holy Spirit and He said, "Though you speak with tongues of men and
   angels and have not love, charity, you are nothing." That confuses people. They speak in tongues
   
   10
   and think the race is completed. You may not even have gotten started yet. You may have just
   got blessed of the Lord and spoke in tongues then again you might have went into an assembly
   that's polluted with devils and the devil rested upon you and you spoke in false tongues because
   down in the desert we find out, Brother Joe, that the Indians down there drank blood out of a
   skull and speak in tongues and gave the interpretation.
   And yet the Pentecostal church trying to get their people to enter on this race based their
   whole experience upon speaking in tongues. So therefore, they've been shipwrecked on the race
   course. They stumbled and fell over a stone and broke their necks. Now it's a bunch of spiritual
   broken-necked people. Can you say, amen? Can you say amen! They are spiritually broken
   down. Is that right! They have run themselves out until that they are at the end of their road but
   they need to get their qualification straightened up. Jesus said, "Repent and be baptized in the
   Name of the Lord Jesus Christ and then you shall receive the Power to run that race." Is that
   right! Then He said, "You'll speak in tongues, you'll prophesy, you'll heal the sick and you'll
   raise the dead." But some want to run the race without getting the qualification. You can't even
   get on the course.
   Isaiah said there was one course to run. He said that was the “broad way.” But he said
   there was another course that was called “a way.” There are restrictions on that way. And on the
   other race course, in the Gospels we find that he said that there was broad race course and he said
   that there was many runners on that race course, many runners on it. Is that right? But he said, at
   the end of it was destruction. But he said on this narrow race course there wasn't many running
   because they didn't want to abide by the restrictions. They didn't want to get baptized in the
   Name of the Lord Jesus Christ because everybody said that was “Jesus Only.” So therefore, they
   got a false baptism. They just worked them up and worked themselves up and up until they
   finally spoke in some kind of words that wasn't their English and somebody said," You got
   it. That's the Holy Ghost." And then you found out that there are things in your life that condemn
   you.
   People who claim to have the Holy Ghost are living in free love and everything else out
   here. You are not even on the race course of Jesus Christ. You are disqualified. Brother, this race
   course is a race of holiness. It’s a race of righteousness. They’re disqualified, Brother Anthony.
   There's qualifications to get on this race course, and it said, “Narrow is the way,” said it
   was pressed and that word “press” means contracted by pressure. Brother, when you get this
   Truth, the same Truth that the apostles were preaching, Brother, there begins to be
   pressure. Brother, every demon in hell, begins trying to pressure you to get you to leave the race
   course. But the Holy Spirit, the Instructor will not let us leave the race course. He is more than
   able to keep us. I don't worry about backsliding. He'll put His arm around me. Of course, I
   backslide little bit every day, probably, but I need to press forward. Is that right? I need to press
   “toward.” Amen.
   I'm so thankful for the Holy Spirit. One man, when I began to tell him and come against
   those doctrines that he believed, by the Word of God, it condemned him and tore them down
   because he had no answer. You got no answer for speaking in tongues is the initial evidence of
   the Holy Ghost. There's no Bible for it and the Word of God condemns it. But it's no use of just
   leaving the race course, Brother. Get the right qualifications and start all over again. For God
   said, "When the Holy Spirit is come, the Instructor, he'll lead you and guide you onto this race
   course. He'll lead you and guide you all through this course, though Satan would plant all kind
   of snares and holes in the way." He said, he would lead you around those holes. He would lead
   
   11
   you out of those snares, Brother, Ray. The Holy Spirit, the Holy Ghost is here. He's faithful and
   He's able to deliver you. Notice, the Bible said that the Holy Spirit, Jesus Christ was more than
   able to make that brother stand. God, the Holy Ghost, will make that brother stand. He said, "I
   thank Thee Father, all that Thou hast given me shall come to me and him that cometh to me I
   will in no wise cast out. All that Thou hast given me I've lost not a one of them on this race
   course."
   I'm here to tell you tonight that every believer of the Lord Jesus Christ will win this
   race. God is going to have a Bride. God is going to have some spiritual runners to run this race.
   Listen, we are heading into the home stretch now. Israel is in its homeland. Oh, we see the line
   right ahead. If you see a white ribbon in it, Joe, your eyes catch a hold of that white ribbon. You
   said… Oh the Bible said, "When you see these signs taking place, when you see earthquakes in
   divers places, when you see famines,” He said, “when you see marrying and giving in marriage
   and drinking and reviling and all these things," He said, "Look up, the race is almost
   finished." We can see the ribbon in sight. We can see it in sight. God is in a prophet; the Pillar of
   Fire is in our midst. The Pillar of Fire is in our midst. “False prophets are lying, God's truth
   they’re denying.” We have the Gospel right in our midst…?...
   Glory to God! We got it. We got the “proof of the pudding.” We need the pudding and
   that’s the proof. Is that right? Israel is in its homeland. “False prophets are lying God's Truth
   they’re denying.” Why? God said, "You don't have the Word of God abiding in you because
   whom God hath sent, Him you receiveth not and that proves you don't have the Word of God. I
   know why you don't have the Word of God in you because you love the praises of men more
   than you love God…?... You don't want to run this course that I want you to run. You want to
   receive a lot of popularity."
   Disqualified. You need to get the qualification. I tell you Peter, Peter certainly had the
   qualification. When three thousand souls cried out one day, when they seen a man that was so or
   who had been eating the hidden manna that was so great that he was just absolutely drunk from
   it. Is that right! He just staggered out of there from that hidden manna. Is that right? Because he'd
   often wondered about what the hidden manna was. But when his Master, Jesus, the first great
   Runner said, "Except you eat My Flesh and drink My Blood you can't even run this race," that
   almost stumbled, Peter. But he said, "Lord, I can't go anywhere." He said, "I don’t know where I
   could go. I'll just have to wait on this thought about your flesh."
   I tell you, when that sound came that day, Peter found out what that Flesh and Blood
   was. He hollered, “More Blood, Lord.” And he began to guzzle, guzzle, guzzle, guzzle and,
   when he staggered down out of the upper room, three thousand runners cried out. They had been
   running but they were disqualified because what came down out of the upper room, gave them a
   disqualification. Is that right! Oh boy, they lost their rules then and they were pricked in their
   heart because they found out that they were disqualified. They were disqualified. They failed to
   go and eat of the hidden Manna. Failed to eat that hidden Manna and drink that Blood. So, they
   were pricked in their heart and said, "Oh Mr. Runner, Peter, what in the world are we going to
   do? How in the world can we enter this race?"
   He said, "Boy, don't live under the law. You can't run that race under the law. You can't
   run this race you don't have enough strength. Get what I just got up there and you'll be able to
   run because He said, "I shall give you Power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you." Do
   you want to receive power? Do you want to receive power? Then Peter said, "Repent every one
   
   12
   of you runners and be baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ, then you shall receive power to run
   this race. You shall receive power."
   He promised us power if we would be baptized in Jesus’ Name. How many want that
   Power to run this race, tonight? Then stand to your feet and let's receive this power tonight. Do
   you want to run a race that will be fitting to Jesus Christ? Stand to your feet. How many say,
   amen. Let's raise our hands and praise God for the power. Amen. Hallelujah!
   Oh Lord, send the Power just now and baptize every one. Would you not like to have
   God that created the heavens and the earth to come down and tabernacle himself inside of you
   tonight? Lovely Lord Jesus. Hallelujah, Amen. (Much praising the Lord by congregation)
   Let's all keep our minds on the Lord. Look straight up. Raise your hands to heaven and
   worship the Lord. Keep your minds on Him. Worship Jesus. Jesus, we love You, Lord. We
   praise You. We thank You, Lord, for blessing this people, God. We thank You, Holy Spirit for
   being in our midst, Lord. Bless everyone, Father God.
   Amen. We thank you, Lord Jesus, for blessing us, Father God. Father God, speak to our
   hearts. Father God, give us the interpretation, in Jesus' name. Amen. It needs an interpreter,
   Lord. Father, we pray that You will give us the interpretation, Lord. We ask it humbly, in Jesus'
   name, Amen. Congregation praises the Lord. A lapse in the tape
   The way to receive the blessing of the Lord is to make love to the Lord. As we begin to
   sing this song. Listen to Brother Bob, now. you just meditate upon how wonderful Jesus is to
   you. How much you thank Him and praise Him for His dying for you. And as you make love to
   the Lord Jesus and then sing to Him and your heart, begins to make love to Him then that brings
   a contact with His Spirit and yours. Then he’ll pour out his spirit upon you and baptize you with
   the holy ghost and confirm your faith in Him. Amen?
   How many know this little song…?... “Jesus Is The Sweetest Name I Know?” Isn't He
   the sweetest Name you know? Is there one here tonight that may not be in perfect fellowship
   with the Lord Jesus? As we sing this song we pray that the Lord Jesus will bless you and that you
   may know him again in the first love that you had for him. May each one of you out there tonight
   and myself, return if we have ever left our first love in Jesus.
   Soon this heaven or this earth world order, the fashion of this world and its order. It’s
   different languages and its different modes of life, whether you live in the top of so and so
   building or in the basement, whether you speak in German or you speak in English or French,
   that life is soon to pass away and Jesus, the one who we love, is coming back to set up his
   kingdom. So, if you don't know Jesus, I'd like to tell you that He loves you tonight. He loves you
   because he died for you and because he died for you He has given you a covenant and that
   covenant is, “He that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting
   life.” If you don't have everlasting life tonight, we pray that you will find it as you sit in your seat
   if you don't have the Infilling of the Holy Spirit, the Seal of God. Open up your heart and let
   Jesus come and sit upon your throne and be King and Master over your life. Is that right?
   Let us sing this song now. “Jesus Is the Sweetest Name I Know.” Congregation sings.
   Lord, say something to us. Amen. The Lord Jesus has spoken to us in a language that we
   wouldn't understand. We are just all babies so we pray that the Lord would be merciful to us and
   give us the interpretation. You that are gifted, would you pray in your heart. Let us pray.
   Yes, let us praise God, to give Him all praise.

   Number forty-four in the song book. One time I believe it was when they were in the
   presence of the great revival and when the Holy Spirit would come down and strike the people
   some would immediately fall onto the floor and shake and cry and weep and wail and do all
   manner of things and then some of those that would be standing by who was not spiritual would
   think, “Lord maybe this is some kind of an evil spirit or something.” And they said unto John,
   said, "Mr., Dr. Wesley, why, aren't you afraid that this is some kind of a spiritual fanaticism
   or…?" He said "Relax, relax friend and let the Lord have His way."
   The Bible said, "They that worship me, me Jesus, must worship in truth and in
   spirit." Remember that we worship in truth and he, the holy spirit, is here. I would like for those
   who are more grown up in the Lord who has had training, spiritual training to kind of refrain
   from maybe stomping your feet up and down. If the Holy Spirit would fall again when we sing
   this song it would be pleasing to the Lord if we could worship him as calm as we could. I mean
   those who are not under a tremendous power of the holy spirit would not, course all of us at
   times are unable to contain the blessing of the Lord but those that are weak in the Lord when the
   holy spirit would strike them in a sharp anointing that they can feel, naturally they would start to
   scream. So that the rest of us that are growing up. Let us go on worshiping the Lord making love
   to Jesus that he may fall on someone else. Amen.
   So, let our minds drop to another… of anything else beside worshiping the Lord. Now
   how many today… the message that we heard this morning that the Lord has given and the one
   tonight… Do you see how they fit together? How many love this assembly with all of your
   heart? How many love one another with all of your heart? How many desire to see the Lord
   Jesus? I mean a literal river of God flow through here and flood our souls with the power and the
   love of God. Could we do this tonight? Cause I believe maybe Wednesday if the Brethren would
   have me to speak, however it works out. I feel like today, tonight that it would behoove us,
   seeing that the ribbon… We see the finishing line and the white ribbon just ahead. As we
   said, Israel is in its homeland.
   The Spirit of the Gentile’s door is closing. The wrath of God and the judgment of God is
   getting ready to be poured out. How many would today that would say with brother Bob, not out
   loud but by the raising of your hands, “I am tired of obeying the dictates of the sinful man and I
   have talked about my brother and I haven't been faithful in many ways in respect. But I would
   like this day to be able to enter onto this race course though it's almost finished now. But I would
   like to be faithful to this assembly and to my minister. I would like to be faithful to my brothers
   and sisters, never to speak evil of them but only to do good and that I might, above all things,
   speak well of my brothers and sisters that I might edify them, that my whole purpose in life
   might be, Oh God, is there someone today that I could be a blessing to. Is there someone that is
   hungry that I could feed? Is there some brother or sister that doesn't have a coat that I could share
   mine with?
   Is it possible that you could fast a meal, for your assembly, for your ministers? Could you
   pray more? Amen. How many, after today that heard this message, this morning and the one
   tonight would like to enter into this race seeing that the finish line is just ahead and you would
   like to rededicate your life to the Lord Jesus tonight and to this assembly and how many with an
   up raising of hands and say I would like to be in subjection to my brother and sister? How many
   would like to do that? And I would like to prefer my brother and sister above myself? I think
   Jesus would be very pleased, don't you?
   
   14
   So, as we sing this dedication song, “What A Friend We Have In Jesus.” Let us take that
   to our heart that we would come back to service Wednesday night with a new determination and
   a greater effort to live this Christian life so that the others may see Jesus in you and me. Amen.
   Congregation sings, “What A Friend.”
   Brother George Parylla, would you dismiss us in prayer?

   Opening Prayer: Brother Lambert
   Almighty God, we are so grateful to be here. Lord, to fellowship around the name of
   Jesus Christ, through the blood of the Lamb. We’re thankful, Heavenly Father, for these songs
   that were sang, Lord, from the bottom of your saints' hearts, Lord. We’re so thankful, Father
   that we can sit here and meditate and listen upon these things and to know that we’re looking,
   Lord for thy soon coming, Father and to be taken out of this cesspool of iniquity, Lord. To be
   taken out of this hatred and malice and envy and strife and “dog eat dog” life around us,
   Lord. To be carried up into the presence of our savior where we will be with Him at the
   marriage supper of the Lamb. And then to come back upon earth, Heavenly Father, and rule
   and reign with Jesus Christ, our Savior, for a thousand years. My God, we have something to
   praise you for, tonight God. We have something to thank you for, Heavenly Father. We thank
   you for these great things, Father. And now, in the name of Jesus Christ, I take authority,
   power and dominion over every spirit in here. I take it under the name of Jesus Christ and
   under our control, tonight.
   Heavenly Father, we rebuke the devil in the name of Jesus Christ, and break the power
   of Satan over these people, God that they may be set free for the deliverance of your word, in
   the name of Jesus Christ. Father, have mercy upon me, tonight. Make me an able minister
   tonight, Lord by the faithfulness of the Holy Ghost. May he come, Lord that the Gospel may
   be preached under the anointing and the power of the Holy Ghost, in Jesus name. Bless our
   Brother from Jamaica, Brother Brown. Lift him up tonight, God, and encourage him and set
   him on fire for thee. In Jesus name, we ask it.
   I am so thankful... You may be seated, forgive me. I am so thankful for the name of
   Jesus and for the power of the Holy Ghost. Lord God, we have so much to be thankful
   for. And I’m also thankful, tonight to see my precious Brother Brown, even though I do feel
   like repenting to him tonight. You forgive me Brother Brown, for not writing. I have been so
   worried about facing him. I thought, "Oh Lord, have mercy upon me and help me be more
   faithful to write." I don't know... I need prayer along this line and Joe and them know, I don't
   write them either. But if you pray, I’m going to feel guilty more after seeing Brother Brown,
   why I’ll try to be more faithful, Brother Brown, in writing, cause you know how sometimes
   we... Being overseas there and being surrounded by hostile forces to this truth that we’re
   preaching and not having too much ministerial fellowship, well then, I think we should all
   
   2
   remember that we need to write Brother Brown and realize how we might feel if we were in
   his shoes, also.
   But I tell you, I’d like to preach tonight on a little message called “Broken
   Fellowship.” And I think that the Lord has so chosen it that way because we… our minds are
   upon fellowship tonight because our Brother Brown, our precious Brother, is laboring in this
   message which is very persecuted and we are anxious to fellowship around the word, Is that
   right? And around the Blood of Jesus. So much has been said, tonight, about fellowship. You
   know, I didn’t… I just felt that Brother Brown was going to be here today because I had a
   message on fellowship. And I asked Brother Hunt, when we got out in the car. I said, "Isn't
   Brother Brown here yet?" And he said, "No, no, he’s not here yet." I said, "Oh my!" So, when
   we got there, we found out that he’d just arrived. So, I certainly am thankful for that, that
   Brother Brown is with us tonight.
   Now if you’ll open your Bibles, we’ll hurriedly go right into the word and read from
   the fifteenth chapter of John and the seventh verse. How many feel victory in your life
   because of this overcoming prayer we have been persevering in? Can you say, Amen? Did
   you feel like the service was lifted up to a little bit higher realm tonight, wasn't it? I see we’re
   reaping the benefit of our overcoming evil nature. Is that right? Can you say, Amen one more
   time? Amen. Do you feel like there has been a change in you the last week? Can you say,
   Amen? I tell you there has been a change in me, too. Now reading from the fifteenth chapter
   and the seventh verse.
   John 15:7-Ad lib Scripture Reading:
   Jesus said, “if ye abide in me, and my Words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it
   shall be done unto you.” Amen.
   I think this Scripture points to a wonderful fellowship. “If ye abide in Me and My
   Words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will and it shall be done” Is that right? “ unto you” I
   think this is a wonderful fellowship, when we can abide in such a fellowship as this with the
   Lord Jesus Christ. So, whatever we ask in his name, Jesus, it shall be done. Not "maybe so"
   but it shall be done. The entire plan of redemption points to the wonderful word,
   “fellowship.” For what would redemption and a new creation mean if God had no fellowship
   with His children? Is that right? The reason why believers are unable to get into the word and
   enjoy the fruits and privileges in Christ, is because their fellowship is either broken or they
   have a very low type of fellowship. The happiness of the home... Which, you know about
   fellowship in the home, the fellowship in the home between the members of that
   household. There would never be a divorce case if the fellowship between the husband and
   the wife continued on. Is that right? It is only when that fellowship of husband and wife is
   broken that there comes a divorce. Right?
   Now when one is born again and becomes a new creation, the highest joy of
   fellowship that spirit of the individual can receive comes from his perfect fellowship with his
   Lord and Savior when he is first born again and falls madly in love with Jesus. He has a
   beautiful fellowship with the Lord Jesus Christ. He has fallen in love with the Savior,
   God. Amen. That’s real fellowship.
   Now there is many things that would break this fellowship with the Lord Jesus Christ
   and we’re gonna dwell on a few of those things. One thing that breaks the fellowship in the
   
   3
   home, just getting in the home, now, is the thoughtless act that you commit against one
   another. The unkind word or the hateful look that you give your wife or your children. Is that
   right? This wound’s the heart and bruises the spiritual nature, thereby breaking fellowship in
   the home. When the fellowship is broken in the home of the believers, it leaves the home open
   to all sorts of manifestations of evil power. Is that right? And when the fellowship of the home
   is broken, we bring that Broken Fellowship into the body of the Lord Jesus Christ and thereby
   try to break up the whole fellowship around the name of Jesus and the Power of God. Can you
   say, Amen?
   Now, fellowship is not a mental thing, it’s a spiritual thing. The mind comes in
   harmony with the spirit and enriches the fellowship that you have. When you have perfect
   harmony in the mind toward the word of God, toward the saints of God, toward your Savior in
   accordance with the word, then you have harmony in your fellowship with your Savior, Is that
   right? With your family, with your brothers and sisters in Christ Jesus.
   Now when this fellowship is broken with the Lord, the Bible becomes a closed Book.
   Is that right? The Bible becomes a closed Book for the simple reason that the same Bible that
   once blessed you, now, because that you have broken fellowship with the Lord Jesus Christ, it
   comes to condemn you. So therefore, you cannot open it because everything in the Bible
   condemns you. So then, if you have no positive fellowship with the Lord Jesus Christ and you
   have a broken fellowship with the Lord Jesus Christ, you have no hunger for the word of
   God. Henceforth, it becomes a closed book and... as you heard the old song "Dust Upon the
   Bible." Dust begins to settle upon the Bible because of broken fellowship. But when that
   believer is in a perfect fellowship with the Lord Jesus Christ, the word of God gives that
   person nothing but joy. Then when this fellowship is broken, no desire to read the word, you
   have no desire to pray either. The best that you can do is, through terrible condemnation, you
   fall down upon your knees at night and say a little prayer about two or three minutes long,
   "Lord thank you for this day, and jump in the bed and you know that God never heard you. So
   therefore, you never had any overcoming prayer because you knew that your fellowship with
   your Jesus was broken. No appetite for the word of God. No desire to pray any longer. Is that
   right?
   Now, another reason for Broken Fellowship could be, as John put it in I John
   1:3... How would you like to read I John 1:3? I’ll read it and you can just note this to save
   time. John telling us about fellowship goes like this.
   1 John 1:3-Scripture Reading;
   3 That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship
   with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.
   We’re not gathered here, tonight, to fellowship around any other thing but the Lord
   Jesus Christ and his word. That’s all. Then, by this, we have a perfect fellowship with one
   another. Can you say, Amen? Now, you take... Happiness and joy are things that you reap
   from a perfect fellowship with Christ. Is that right? Now there is a difference between
   happiness and joy. Happiness comes from the right association. Is that right? But Joy comes
   from a perfect fellowship with your Heavenly Father and through his word. This gives you
   joy. It is a wonderful experience to have, that you are able through this perfect fellowship with
   the Lord Jesus Christ, you are able to say, “In the name of Jesus, I cast you out, evil
   
   4
   spirits.” “In the Name of Jesus, I take dominion and power over all the authority of the
   devil." This creates joy. Is that right? You can bring this kind of joy to the heart of your
   Heavenly Father, and joy to your own heart because your Heavenly Father receives joy when
   the devil's works are stopped in his tracks. And the works of the devil can only be stopped
   when, through a perfect fellowship with Jesus Christ, you are able to stop him because of that
   perfect fellowship. Because you have confidence in your heart that whatsoever you asked in
   his name, he shall do it because you please him. Amen.
   We have a three-fold fellowship: first, a fellowship with the Father. Is that right? A
   fellowship with his word, a fellowship with one another. This is a perfect fellowship in the
   Assembly. Any other kind of fellowship that we may have comes not... doesn’t amount to
   very much. But if we can fellowship in this three-fold fellowship, first with the Father, then
   with his word, then with one another, then we’re “walking in the Light as he’s in the light,
   having fellowship one with another. And the Blood of Jesus Christ, His Son cleanseth us from
   all sin,” through this type of fellowship.
   Oh, what a fellowship, oh what a joy divine, leaning on the Everlasting Arm. I want to
   teach this instead of preaching it because I think you’ll get it better. We really need this. Now,
   one of the greatest reasons, just one, I said, that I know of to break fellowship with your
   Heavenly Father is this: one of the greatest, and that is to fail to love your brother or
   sister. Failure to love your brother and sister because of their outward appearance, or failure to
   love them because they didn't do something you like, failure to love them because they don't
   come over and fellowship with you enough, or whatever reason you may find. When you don't
   love your brother or sister, then you have a broken fellowship with Jesus Christ and you are
   open for all the power of the devil then. This is one thing that’s holding the Bride of Jesus
   Christ back. Open your Bibles real quick to
   1 John 2:9-Scripture Reading;
   9 He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkness even until now.
   I don't care if you say that you’re sitting at the feet of a prophet. If you say that you
   believe every bit of the message, but if you don't have perfect love towards your brother and
   sister, you are walking in darkness, my friend, and you have a broken fellowship with Jesus
   Christ. You broke your fellowship right then. That is what John said. Now, read on down.
   1 John 2:10-11-Scripture Reading;
   10 He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is none occasion of stumbling in
   him.
   11 But he that hateth his brother is in darkness, and walketh in darkness, and knoweth not
   whither he goeth, because that darkness hath blinded his eyes.
   John said that, that brother who didn't love his brother with a perfect love, though he
   said he was in the truth, John said, I don't care what you say, you’re walking in darkness. And
   you cannot be led by the Spirit of God because you have got a broken fellowship the first time
   that you didn't love your brother. You broke fellowship with Jesus and Jesus is not leading
   you by His Spirit. So therefore, Brother, you are walking in darkness. Glory to God! Walking
   in darkness because you don't love your brother and sister like you should. You can't be led by
   
   5
   the Holy Spirit. Thereby, because you have broken fellowship, because you talked about your
   brother and you didn't love him, you broke fellowship with Jesus Christ and you’re not led by
   the Spirit any longer. And when you are not led by the Spirit, you fulfill the lust of the flesh. I
   tell you, a fellowship with Jesus means something. Glory to God!
   I John 3:9-Reading
   Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for His Seed remaineth in him, and he cannot
   sin, because he is born of God.
   But we ain't going to stop there. You get a wrong impression of that Scripture if you
   don't read any further. You say, "Well, we are predestinated and we can dislike a brother, we
   can do anything we want to because we’re predestinated before the foundation of the world."
   That is wallowing around in that evil nature again, but that evil nature has been
   severed by Jesus Christ and by the Power of the Holy Ghost and you cannot sin because you
   are walking in the righteousness of Jesus Christ doing His Will after the Spirit of God. Can
   you say, Amen? “In this the children of God are manifested.” Said, in this right here, the
   children of God are manifested from the children of the devil.
   1 John 3:10-Reference quote:
   10 In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not
   righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother.
   YOU CAN BE A CHILD OF THE DEVIL AND STILL BE BELIEVING IN
   NINETY-NINE PERCENT OF THE WORD OF GOD, BUT IF YOU DON'T LOVE YOUR
   BROTHER, MY GOD! YOU’RE WALKING IN DARKNESS. HALLELUJAH! AND THE
   SPIRIT OF GOD CAN'T LEAD YOU OR GUIDE YOU. I tell you that, tonight. That’s what
   the Bible said. John said, "Brother, you’re walking in darkness and you don't know where
   you’re going." Glory to God. That’s the truth. I feel that one! My! John said, "Herein," said,
   "Herein was the children of God made manifested and the children of darkness." John said,
   "We know that if you walk in love, if you walk in love, but if you walk in the walk of the
   believer, you say you are a believer and believe all the truth in the message in the hour, and
   don't love your Brother, you’re walking in darkness and don't know it. John said, "You don't
   even know what you’re doing, brother." You don't even know where you’re going. You can
   say you’re led by the Spirit but you’re not.
   Now, I John... I want to read that a little bit.
   1 John 3:11-12-Scripture Reading;
   11 For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another.
   12 Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him?
   Because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous.
   You take a person that has got in their heart anything against a brother or sister, right
   away he breaks fellowship with Jesus Christ, right away. And then if he continues to do that…
   Is, that right? He is open for all the demon force, that the devil has. Is, that right? And then

   when that brother... He is still walking though, but he don't know it but his path is in
   darkness. His path is darkness, he don't know which way he is going, so therefore he makes
   all kinds...
   I know what I'm talking about, I have reached this right here, Brother. I have reached
   this right here. I’m not... maybe on that point right there, but another point. I broke fellowship
   with Jesus Christ by another point. And I know why... I am able to preach this message
   tonight because I have experienced it. When you break fellowship with Jesus Christ, you’re
   open for everything the devil's got for ya. Can you say, Amen? You can't be led by the Spirit
   any longer. Amen. And then you don't want to be around your spiritual brothers any more
   that is walking in the Light because the very life that they live, condemns your false works. So
   therefore, you break fellowship with them, too. Can you say, Amen? Because the life that they
   live condemns you and shows you that you are not walking in the Spirit. Glory to God! John
   knew something about fellowship, Friend, same reason.
   We don't love our brother, usually, because we either got some personal thing against
   him or you take a brother that brother is being used of God. And if that brother is being used
   of God and the power of God is upon him, another brother will get in his heart a little bit of
   jealousy. Right then that brother broke fellowship with Jesus Christ and his path becomes
   darkness. And then he begins to hate that brother and finds everything wrong with him he can
   and begins to accuse him. He made himself just like Cain who slew his Brother because his
   own works was unrighteous. Brother, there is a lot of slaying going on, today. There sure are a
   lot of natures of Cain around today. Brother, if you got a Cain nature tonight, repent of that
   thing and take on the Nature of Jesus Christ.
   John said, "Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer." Brother, you can talk about
   the front pages on the magazines, you can talk about the papers that come out, this one
   murdered or that one, but I tell you, if you talk about your brother, if you talk about your
   sister, if you’re not in subjection to your pastor and to your elders and to your deacons,
   brother you're just as big a murderer as Cain ever was. You put yourself under the law, you’re
   disfellowshipped from the Body of Jesus Christ and from the fellowship of the Lamb. Glory
   to God! Repent and get under the Blood. Yes, amen! That’s amen, it’s the Word anyway. I
   John 4:20. Course if you’re in broken fellowship, you can't say, Amen! You know, it will
   condemn you. John said...
   1 John 4:20-Scripture quote:
   If a man say I love God, and hateth his Brother, he is a liar. But he that loveth not his Brother
   whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?
   I tell you that makes sense to me because Jesus Christ is dwelling in your brother. So,
   if you speak one word against your brother, you’re speaking against Jesus Christ and you
   broke your fellowship. Oh, I tell you, that word will sure hem us up. Might as well repent and
   make it right. Only one way out for us, is repent. So, glad there is room for repentance. You
   heard that song: "There's Room at the Cross." There is room, yes sir. John said, "If you say, if
   you hate your brother and you are walking in the light," said, "You are a liar. I tell you that,
   that might seem uncouth for some of us today. But I tell you those Apostles didn't hold back,
   they would not... I am so glad that my God is not a respecter of persons. And the same word
   that I have to turn to, I don't care who you are, you got to come to the same word because God
   
   7
   is no respecter of persons. He don't care if you’re yellow, black or white, green or purple. God
   is no respecter of persons. All you have to do is obey the word of God and God is going to
   vindicate you; God is going to bless you; God is going to pour out His spirit upon you,
   overcome your life... Hallelujah! Glory to God!
   God said, "Cain if you didn't do well," said "won't God bless you? He said, "Cain if
   you do well, won't God bless you?" He told Cain, said "I am not a respecter of persons,
   Cain. You come on and get right with Me and I’ll bless ya." Then if God is blessing
   somebody else, I’m not gonna get jealous because, when I get jealous I make myself a
   Canaanite. All you Canaanites, tonight, repent and get under the Blood of Jesus Christ. Get
   that old evilness out of your heart. Start loving one another. Hallelujah!
   One more reason... I tell you, the Word of God will thin this thing down where there
   ain't going to be no room for sin, brother. The devil ain't going to have no room to work in
   here. The only way he can work is work outside somewhere. Amen. One more great reason I
   know, and it’s a big one, too, to break fellowship with the Lord Jesus Christ. John said if we
   love the world... Is that right? He said, "Love not the world neither the things that are in the
   world, if any man say that he... If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not even in
   that man." I don't care if he says he has got the Baptism of the Holy Ghost; I don't care if he
   says he’s listening to the Truth; I don't care if he says he sits right at the feet of a prophet. My
   Brother, if you’re in love or Sister with the things of the world, then the Love of God don't
   even dwell in you. You have got a broken fellowship with Jesus. You need to restore your
   fellowship. You women need to... The Bible said that the things of the world and the things of
   the flesh. Is that right? One of the things of the flesh, is the lust of the eye and if you women
   are lusting after how good looking you are, if you’re lusting in the mirror of how pretty your
   figure is or how pretty that dress is and if everybody is going to look at you, you got a broken
   fellowship tonight. You have broken fellowship with Jesus. You need to repent and get right
   with God. Can you say, Amen?
   Anybody that would love the world series and love to sit down and watch ball games,
   love the big fine cars, love all this, you know that they don't have no fellowship with Jesus
   because if you’re fellowshipping with Jesus, you hate those things. Glory to God. You love
   the things of God. Hallelujah! You love righteousness, joy. Hallelujah! The Bible said, "The
   world passeth away, and the lust thereof but he that doeth the will of God abideth
   forever." Hallelujah. That’s what I want.
   One more reason for a broken fellowship, is a failure to obey the word as it is
   ministered unto you. Don't put it off for another day, because if you hear the word of God
   ministered, obey the word of God then you’ll walk in the light as he is in the light. Failure to
   obey the word of God from the ministers, reaps a broken fellowship. Oh God, I tell ya, there
   are those that would stay with the word of God, though. Is that right? They have a perfect
   fellowship. They have a blessed purifying hope, that even is as he is pure, I am pure. Even as
   He shall appear, I shall be like him. If I abide in him and he abides in me I can ask what I
   will. Can you say, Amen? Amen.
   Yes, many like to fellowship, not in the Spirit, but in the flesh. They find their
   fellowship around... because, well, I’m German, all the Germans come over to my house and
   fellowship. I’m colored, all the colored come over and fellowship with me, or I’m a Japanese,
   all you Japanese brothers come over and fellowship with me and we’ll speak in Japanese;
   we’ll speak in Italian; we’ll speak in this and we will speak in that. But I tell you one thing,
   
   8
   there’s only one thing that we can fellowship around, not because we’re this color, or we’re
   another color or we speak this language and you speak that language.
   Listen, we’re lookin for a City whose Builder and Maker is God. We just have one
   thing to fellowship around, that is the Lord Jesus Christ. I tell you I am looking for a City
   whose Builder and Maker is God, I’m not going to fellowship around anything but Jesus
   Christ and his own righteousness. That’s what I base my fellowship on. I tell you, God ain't no
   respecter of persons. He don't care what kind of house he dwells in, God don't care whether its
   black, yellow, green or white. He don't care what the color of the house is, he wants to know
   whether or not that house is going to obey the word of God or do the will of God. Amen. God
   is no respecter of persons. Any time that you get to thinkin, why you’re so self-righteous and
   you’re so handsome and you’re so this and you’re so that, that, oh, you are just “walking in
   the Light.” Brother, you’re walking in darkness. God wants you to clean up your house, so
   that he can really dwell in it. God ain't going to dwell in no fellowship like that. He’s not
   going to fellowship with your pride and your exalted spirit. Humble yourself under the mighty
   hand of God, that God may exalt you, brethren.
   You look around and see those things you hear tonight, you look around and see the
   different houses in here, the different colors. You find out some of them speaks broken
   German, broken Italian, broken this, broken... I speak broken English because I am from the
   South. But I tell one thing, we’re not fellowshipping around those things. We’re
   fellowshipping around Jesus. We have one purpose in mind, to exalt the word. We don't exalt
   one another, we exalt this right here. Glory to God!
   I know a man one time by the name of Saul. He had a wonderful fellowship with
   God. He had such a wonderful fellowship, at one time, that the spirit of God was in such
   oneness with him, that he begin to prophesy and he never had before. Prophesied all day, and
   was drunk on the Spirit of God. I said, "Drunk on it." And even said his wife, "Is Saul
   numbered with the prophets?" Is that right? And he was of such humility, that when Samuel
   come and told them, said, "You have a king among you." Said, "Saul, come here." Saul was
   so humble before the Lord, he felt so unworthy of this fellowship with God, that God would
   speak to Saul and call him. Listen, he hid under the corn shucks of humility. I tell you, we
   need to crawl under some corn shucks tonight. There’s too much pride. There’s too many
   exalted spirits. Oh, get under the corn shucks of humility tonight. Why, get into a perfect
   fellowship with Jesus Christ your Lord. (Break in tape)
   Forgot about his corn shuck of humility. And Samuel said, "Go down to this place and
   wait seven days and I’ll come down and we’ll offer a sacrifice to Jehovah." Saul went down
   there and, because of the people, began to murmur and complain because the Philistines were
   getting ready to charge in upon them. Saul, because he wanted to please the people and be
   popular, he took himself out of his calling and made himself a minister and offered up his own
   sacrifice. Then the word of the Lord come to Samuel and He walked up there and said, "You
   done a foolish thing. You done a foolish thing by trying to exalt yourself into a position that
   you should not be." How much more should you and I remain in a position that God has given
   us. I don't care how little it is, I don't care how big it is, remain there in humility and God will
   exalt us in due time.
   Oh, that pride... it exalts you. Well, Saul had a good excuse, though, he gave Samuel a
   good excuse. I want to tell yea tonight, you have no excuse if you’ve broken fellowship with
   Jesus. I don't care what kind of excuse it is that you find, it won't hold up under the word of
   
   9
   God. All you need to do tonight is repent and get under the Blood of Jesus. We find that, later
   on, Saul never did repent of this. Then there come another time for a testing. Samuel... The
   word of the Lord came to Samuel, the prophet, and he said, "King Saul," he said, "Remember
   Amalek, how he treated the children of Israel." He said, "Go down there and destroy that King
   and all of his people both man and woman and both children and every ass and every horse
   and every cow, every chicken, every hog," said, "Everything that is down there, kill it." Then
   the word of the Lord left. The prophet is the word of the Lord, he left.
   God was gonna to test Saul, to see whether or not he would rather have his fellowship
   or the fellowship of the popularity of his kingdom. We find that, when the test came, they
   went down to battle and overcame the king. And instead of Saul going up right then and doing
   the will of God, He looked at that king and saw his priestly robe and everything and thought it
   would be a shame to kill that great king. Maybe I will take him home and just torture him a
   little bit. And then he seen all them beautiful Hereford cows, I don't know what kind they had,
   probably big beautiful cows.
   And he seen all these beautiful things that he had built up in that kingdom. So, Saul
   right then got a covetous spirit in his heart and he broke fellowship with Jesus Christ right
   then. When that thought entered the heart of Saul, he should have fell down and repented to
   God and offered up a sacrifice. How much more should you and I, my friend, when a little bit
   of jealousy, a little bit of hatred enters in your heart for a person. You ought to repent right
   then or the devil is going to take you over. You’re going to be led into the lust of the
   flesh. The devil is going to use you in a mighty way, if you don't repent of that sin right
   now. If you don't repent tonight, when you walk from this door tonight and you heard this
   message, if you don't put everything out of your heart, God is going to turn you over to a devil
   and you’re gonna reap a whirlwind. Well, amen! Glory to God!
   Well, Saul didn't get that thing out of his heart. He said, "Oh! it will be all right, I’ll
   get by some way. I’ll get by some way." All the people got the same spirit on them, too. Oh,
   we find the word of the Lord come to Samuel that night. Said, "Oh Samuel, my faithful
   prophet," said, "It grieves me that I ever called this man, Saul. He didn't obey my word," He
   said. "Go up an tell him, 'Thus saith the Lord, The kingdom is rent from you." Samuel, the
   faithful to the Word of the Lord, went up there and said to Saul... Saul seen him coming, said,
   " Oh, oh, prophet, Samuel," he said, "We have done the will of the Lord. I have obeyed the
   Lord," he said. Samuel looked at him, "Son," said, "what is the bleating of all these sheep that
   I hear then." "Oh," he said, "That, oh, that is nothing, Samuel." He said, "I saved…Listen at
   this now. "I saved the best for the Lord thy God to offer worship upto him."
   Samuel said, "Obedience is better than your sacrifice." God wants you to obey the
   word of God. You say, "Glory to God, I hand out tracts in the street, Glory to God, I go to the
   hospitals every Sunday and Glory to God, I go to the jails and witness to the sinners." But
   when it comes to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, you bring your sacrifices
   up to God. And God said, "Depart from me," on that day, I never did know you, you worker
   of iniquity." Obedience is better than sacrifice. My God, let us obey the word of
   God. Hallelujah!
   Well, Saul... Must have kind of frightened him. He backed up and said, "Well," he
   said, "I forced myself to do it. I forced myself to do it. The people pressed sore upon me,
   Samuel. I forced myself to do it." But my God, I want to tell you that God didn't feel sorry for
   
   10
   Saul. Saul loved the praises of man more than the praises of God. He wanted the fellowship of
   that kingdom more the fellowship of God. He fell from his first love.
   Take heed, tonight, lest you don't restore your first love tonight, brother or sister. Is
   that right? I tell you God never does break fellowship. You break fellowship by disobeying
   His word. I said, you break fellowship, God never breaks fellowship, he loves fellowship. He
   has joy in fellowship. That’s right. Can you say, Amen? I tell you it is about time that you and
   I got into a perfect fellowship with Jesus Christ. I tell you, what joy can you have, whatever
   joy can you have outside of Jesus Christ? There is no joy in the bars; there is no joy in the ball
   game; there is no joy in watching television. That is a big lie. There is only joy in the Holy
   Ghost; there is only joy in the Kingdom of God; there is only joy by obeying the word of
   God. That is joy unspeakable and full of glory.
   Saul sold out to the devil. I tell you, any time you sell out God's fellowship for the
   fellowship of a television or for the things of the world, anytime you women will
   disfellowship the Lord Jesus Christ by some spirit that is upon you to make you want to be
   lustful after some men, you have broken fellowship with Jesus Christ. You would rather have
   that than the fellowship of the lovely Savior. My God, that’s right, but have mercy Lord, have
   mercy upon us tonight. My God. We got a curse on us here, Brother Brown. That’s right we
   have got a curse on us. That is the filthy things of the world. Got us so bound down we can't
   pray. We can't seek God. My God! Let us set aside these things and get on fire for Jesus Christ
   and obey the word of God. Can you say, Amen? Then we’ll have a wonderful fellowship.
   I know some people, one time, by the name of Peter and John. They must have had a
   wonderful fellowship, cause they find that Peter and John went down to the gate Beautiful,
   one day, and because they had fellowship with Jesus, they was able to look down on a poor
   man that was impotent from his mother's womb, about thirty-eight years. And they was able
   by a perfect fellowship to look down because they were abiding in that fellowship, and his
   word was abiding in them. And he said, "Silver and gold have I none, but such as I have, give
   I thee. In the name of Jesus, rise up and walk." That was a perfect fellowship.
   I tell you, I know another man by the name of Paul and another man by the name of
   Silas, when they had preached the Word of God faithfully, they threw them into jail. They
   thought they had them all penned in, but about midnight, they began to have fellowship with
   Jesus Christ and the walls came tumbling down by an earthquake. That is the kind of
   fellowship you and I need tonight. We don't need the fellowship around ball games. We don't
   need to fellowship around what nationality we are. We need to fellowship around Jesus
   Christ, not nationality. Looking for a Kingdom whose Builder and Maker is God.
   The early church had a fellowship, Brother. When they were persecuted for the Name
   of Jesus Christ, they gathered themselves together in a fellowship around the Blood of Jesus
   Christ and the name of the Lord, and they begin to pray and to fellowship in Jesus' name. And
   the whole building where they were assembled was shaken by the mighty impact of Almighty
   God. I believe that God is able to shake this building tonight. He could make those people,
   now, fall over in their seats, Glory to God by a perfect fellowship, by love in obeying the
   word of God.
   I tell you, the apostle, John, had a fellowship that must have been wonderful. No
   wonder that John was able to write about fellowship. He knew what it was. He was walking in
   such a fellowship that they put him down in a big boiling pot to try to break up this
   fellowship. But it only made it better and, though the oil got hotter, the fellowship got greater
   
   11
   and the joy of God was upon John because he knew that oil could not hurt him. Neither can
   anything hurt you and I, my friend, if we have a perfect fellowship. A perfect fellowship with
   Jesus Christ. We can overcome all things through Jesus Christ and a perfect fellowship. Well,
   amen. I believe I got some fellowship. I am getting more joyful every time I preach, too. Yes
   Sir!
   John had such a wonderful fellowship, they put him over on the Isle of Patmos. John
   wrote a letter, said, "I John, your brother in tribulation." I don't care if Brother Brown is over
   on the island of Jamaica. If he’s got a perfect fellowship with Jesus Christ, God is able to
   shake that island of Jamaica with a perfect fellowship in Jesus Christ. The blind are able to see
   and the lame are able to walk and the poor have the Gospel preached unto them for a witness
   with a perfect fellowship with Jesus Christ. Amen. I said, greater is he that is in you than he
   that is in the world.
   Out of fellowship, means you stopped growing in Grace. Out of fellowship, means
   that when you stop growing in Grace you start walking in the flesh. It’s the only thing that you
   can do. When any of these things come your way and you break fellowship with Jesus, you
   are walking in the flesh. Then you bring all of that trouble into the assembly of the Lord Jesus
   Christ. And if you don't repent of it, tonight, and get back into a perfect fellowship with Jesus
   Christ, God Almighty will hold you and I responsible on Judgment Day for holding back that
   brother or sister that never got healed. I said, God will do it, He will do it. We’ll give account
   for it. Why, when you have broken fellowship, when you have this broken fellowship with
   Jesus you have no answer to prayer, you have no power over Satan, no faith at all. What a
   terrible condition you have let... you and I have let Satan put upon us. Can you say, "Amen?"
   And most of all, you are losing precious time that we should be
   redeeming. Hallelujah. Losing precious time that we should be redeeming by the Grace of
   God. And worst of all of that, you lose all rewards when you are walking in the flesh. You
   can't reap one thing on that day for that labor that you labored in the flesh. Oh my! Let us
   labor in the Spirit with the Love of God in our hearts for every brother and sister in Christ. Is
   that right? I tell ya, if there is a one here, tonight, that has a broken fellowship with Jesus,
   won't you come back to the Lord Jesus, tonight, and confess your sins? Because John--that
   same man that knew about fellowship--said, "If we confess our sins he is faithful and just to
   forgive those sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. Can you say, Amen?
   Sinner Friend, if you have one thing in your heart against any brother or sister and you
   have not made it right, you’ve got a broken fellowship. Broken fellowship, can't grow in
   Grace...
   The Sister will play 'Jesus is the Sweetest Name I Know.' What an hour to be living in
   and have a broken fellowship with God. I tell you Friend, tonight, with your head bowed and
   every eye closed. I tell you tonight that Jesus loves you, there is nothing in this world, that you
   could compare to a sweet fellowship with Jesus Christ. There is nothing, I tell ya, there is
   nothing that is upon this earth could get sweet as to have a perfect fellowship with Jesus
   Christ. I tell ya, God is in an investigating judgment, right now, to see whether or not you and
   I are going to obey the word of God. I tell ya, just as Saul was on investigating judgment by
   God. Oh, how sorry Saul was when he found out that he had disobeyed God, because he didn't
   repent of those things that was in his heart. And he turned and grabbed the prophet by his
   robe, his mantel and when he grabbed it and said, "Samuel, oh prophet of God, come back and
   just fellowship with the Lord with me. Come back and let us worship the Lord together." And
   
   12
   the prophet, how he must of... Tears must have rolled down his face and he looked at that man
   who had disobeyed the Word of God and had things in his heart that he should not have. And
   he said, "I am sorry Saul, I cannot fellowship with you because you are walking in darkness,
   now. And he turned out of desperation to pray with Samuel because he was in perfect
   fellowship with God. And he knew that his prayers and darkness had moved over Saul and he
   knew that he could not pray and have fellowship with God. He could not feel that Spirit upon
   him to prophesy anymore. He didn't have his first love anymore. He had lost that because he
   let these things stay in his heart. And out of desperation Saul turned and grabbed a hold of the
   garment of the prophet and it rent. And the Word of the Lord came to the prophet and he said,
   "So has God, rent the kingdom from you and given to a man that is better than you."
   I tell you, better is he, tonight, that is working and laboring in the Spirit of
   God. Blessed is he tonight that is laboring after the Spirit of God. I tell you, God is no
   respecter of persons. Everyone here tonight will have to come and think... and obey the same
   word of God that was given to Saul. I tell ya tonight, I think if there is someone here tonight
   that has anything down in their heart, I tell ya God is able to reach down and rip that thing out
   tonight. As we sing this song. "Jesus Is the Sweetest Name I Know."
   How many, with your eyes closed and worshiping the Lord, would lift your hand and
   say, Brother Bob, I want you to pray for me? I have got things in my heart. Oh, it's been a
   long time since I had an answer to prayer. Oh, it's been a long time since I felt the Spirit of
   God in my life and know that I am in perfect fellowship." You know, tonight, sinner Friend,
   whether or not you are in perfect fellowship with Jesus. I’m so happy, the last few days. Oh, I
   thank you for being able to preach to you up here. I tell ya, it has restored me to a
   fellowship. It has renewed my love for Jesus and a burning down inside to preach the
   Gospel. I love you and I thank you for everything that you have done for me up here. And oh,
   tonight, oh God, that I could see fruit in this message, that every person here that has anything
   in their heart. Oh God, you know what it is, you know what it is.
   As we sing this song, don't you love him tonight? Has He not done all things well? As
   we sing this song. The hands is going up now.
   Congregation sings, “Jesus Is the Sweetest Name I know”
   God, bless you, brother. Look at the hands going up. God, bless you, sister. Look at
   that brother. God, bless you, brother. God, bless you, sister. Is there another? God, bless you
   sister and you brother and you Sister. Hands going up all over the place. I tell you, if you’ll
   raise your hand and confess that sin, tonight, God's blood is able to forgive every sin that you
   have committed. He’s able, by the power of God, to root out every bit of that bitterness or
   whatever it is in your heart.

   Shall we bow our heads, <br/>
   please, in a word of prayer?
   Brother Lambert prays opening prayer;
   Heavenly Father, we gather here again this Sunday, Lord, they call it today, Lord Palm
   Sunday I believe. Noticing on the way down in the car, Heavenly Father, the different Catholic
   churches, each one going in, Lord, had a piece of a branch that looked like a palm, Lord.
   Lord, as I seen that, I kind of thought, Father, that, “That wouldn't suffice us, Lord, in this
   terrible hour that we’re living in, just to bring a branch into their service, Father.” But I think the
   greatest thing that we can do, Lord, would be to present our bodies as a living sacrifice to thee,
   prove our love for thee.
   Oh, great Jehovah God, our precious King and Savior, forgive us of our sins this
   morning, Lord, we’re sinners. We realize, Lord, that we’re nothing, God. How much Lord, of
   every day and every hour as it draws closer to thy coming, we realize Lord, our insincerity
   Father, our lack of love and dedication and consecration to thee.
   We realize the separation of the Body of Christ Lord. Oh, different understandings and
   everything, Father. King of Kings, Lord of Lords, come down this morning; mold our hearts
   together in Christian love.
   And Lord, we pray that you’ll vindicate your word this morning, because it has been
   restored to us, Lord. And we believe that we are living now at the brink of a great thing Lord, the
   birth of an Apostolic Church, Father.
   So, we pray this morning Lord, you know what’s upon my heart. You know my prayers
   during the week and my waiting upon You. Fulfill my desire this morning, Lord, and help me to
   be calm Lord, I’m a little nervous this morning, knowing that this is the great day for me, today,
   Lord. So, I pray that you’ll help me, I love these sheep Lord, and I pray that you’ll feed them this
   morning, Lord. I trust in thee. In Jesus' name, amen. You may be seated.
   I’d like to welcome each and every one of you to The Local Christian Assembly of New
   York City, contending for the faith that was once delivered to the saints. I see some of my friends
   here from Connecticut. God bless each one of you. Certainly, glad to see you this morning.
   Now, if there is any strangers in our midst this morning, as the preacher this morning, I’d
   like to welcome you. I know that you won't have come in vain. I Know that God is among us and
   I know you’ve come here not to…if you have…if you’ve come here to… any other reason, then
   worshipping the Lord and trying to receive something from the Lord, you’ll get that. If you’ve
   come for anything else, then you’ll get just what you came for. God promised, if you’re hungry,
   he promised to feed you. And if you’re thirsty, he promised to give you drink.
   I’d like to make a little confession to God's church this morning. As I told you all, the
   other night, there’s something happened to me and has been happening to me for the last few
   months. And, a great trial I’ve been through in the last two or three years, but God has blessed
   
   2
   me this week and he’s just transformed my whole life. And I feel like He’s helped me to grow in
   grace.
   And, when I got this message it was such a shock to me, I…it just took my breath
   away. Knowing that the Lord Jesus led me up here this time, by the Holy Spirit
   supernaturally. Then I realized that I’d better get serious with God, so I began to wait on the
   Lord.
   And Joe Coleman and I know things that I’m not going to say but, by and by, God will
   vindicate whether they was of the Lord or not. And I told Brother Joe, that there was a key
   somewhere to unlock the great baptism of the holy spirit upon his people that was believing that
   we have now received the restoration of the word, but we haven’t received the power that fell on
   Pentecost.

   60 Now, after we get through with the Seven Seals, then, at that time of the sounding of the
   Seventh Seal, or the loosening… Course, we know what a seal is, is to loose the ministry, to
   loose Seven Seals. And we’ll see that right on the chart. Is loosing a Message, something that’s
   sealed up. 61 Last Sunday night, I preached on, “THE KEY.” AND THE KEY IS FAITH. THE
   FAITH HOLDS THE KEY, AND THE KEY IS THE SCRIPTURE. AND CHRIST IS THE
   DOOR. See? So faith takes the little hinges of the Scripture and unlocks the glories and good
   of God, out to His people. See? So, it’s, FAITH HOLDS THE KEY THAT UNLOCKS
   CHRIST TO THE PEOPLE; UNLOCKS IT, REVEALS IT. 62 So, today, we’re going to try to
   take that same key, to unlock the way to become a virtuous Christian in the stature of God,
   that, and be a living Tabernacle for the living God to dwell in.

   William Marrion Branham
   “How You going to do it, Lord?” “I’ll show you how.” 90 And He showed him on the hillside,
   where those pieces represented. And any Bible scholar here knows that each one of those was a
   clean animal that represented the Sacrifice of Jesus Christ. He was the Ram. He was the Heifer
   that made the waters of separation when you had the waters of separation through. Now we
   have the washing by the water, by the Word of the separation from sin, through the Word,
   through believing. And the Pigeon and the Turtledove, was Divine healing, that all in Christ! 91
   And there God showed Abram what He was going to do, that through the Seed of Isaac He would
   bring forth His only begotten Son, Christ, and was slain yonder between the heavens and earth,
   when the sun went down, the blackness over the earth, and there He tore Him apart. God
   pulled His soul out of Him, and He wrote a covenant with the families of the earth. When that
   precious unadulterated Blood of the Almighty God, dripping from Emmanuel’s Veins, He tore
   that soul out of Him. He said, “My God, My God, why has Thou forsaken Me?” His face full of
   mockery spit, a crown of cruel mockery pulled down over His brow, His nails drove, was Roman
   
   3
   spikes, His back riven until His ribs showed through, swinging on the cross, screaming, dying
   sinner’s death, the sin of the world upon Him. And there God rivened His sides, tore His soul
   out of Him, when He said, “Into Thy hands I commend My Spirit,” and He dropped His head.
   And the earth shook and belched out its rocks. THERE HE IS, THERE’S GOD’S
   COVENANT! There’s the fulfilling of it. Mid rendering rocks and darkening skies My Saviour
   bowed His head and died, The opening veil revealed the way To Heaven’s joys and endless
   day. 92 O Calvary, O Calvary, Jesus bled and died for me! Then He tore the soul of His Own
   Son, separated a covenant, and He throwed the Body into the ground. It laid there for three days
   and nights. It rose up! “For it was not possible that My Holy One shall see corruption, neither
   will I leave His soul in hell.” And His soul was His Spirit that ascended into hell. And He rose
   down, God did, and picked up His Body and gave Him life. And took the Body of Jesus and set it
   at His right hand in Glory, AND SENT BACK THE HOLY GHOST AS A COVENANT. 93
   THERE YOU ARE. DON’T FALL SHORT OF THAT, BROTHER. WITHOUT THE
   BAPTISM OF THE HOLY SPIRIT, YOU’RE LOST. That’s the only…You won’t have to
   worry about getting to Heaven. If there’s nothing in here Supernatural, the doors can’t unlock,
   you could walk there and bump your head against it. But if the Spirit of God is in there, THE
   SPIRIT OF GOD INSIDE WILL UNHINGE THE DOORS. GOT TO HAVE THE THING IN
   HERE TO UNLOCK IT yonder. That’s right. So you’re already judged just on what you think
   about Jesus Christ. 94 Now, here He comes, torn, riven, tore to pieces. His soul went to God.
   God blessed Him. And then His soul returned back in the form of the baptism of the Holy Ghost
   that comes into every believer, to sanctify, clean up the mind, clean up the heart, and leave a
   portion of the Holy Ghost in there, here and there. And when the Holy Ghost is given out, that
   same Holy Spirit that brought the Body of Jesus out of the grave, will Rapture. And that
   covenant has to dovetail, as He tore there and gave the Body; went back to God, and the Spirit
   came back to the earth. Then your Spirit will have to be the same kind of a Spirit, or it’ll miss
   that place going together. Amen. Yes, sir. Not because you make yourself, but because
   Something, the love of God has swept into your soul and tore every earthly idol out. There it is.
   95 And there’s something in us, screams and calls to God, it’s your soul in here calling out to the
   Heavenly Father. There you are. That gives you a faith, and you become the Seed of Abraham.
   You believe God’s promise like Abraham did. Though it lingered, yet you believe it. Faithful!
   Abraham staggered not at the promise of God, through unbelief, but was strong, giving praise
   to God.
   Stating... quoting from…. God’s prophet William Branham said, that, "Could you

   73 Oh, could you compare a Christian today with them Christians of long ago? How them
   disciples walked in the power of the Spirit, moved by the Holy Ghost, do it. Just a prisoner, as I
   preached on the other night, a prisoner to the Word and will of God; he couldn’t even move until
   
   4
   God moved him. Wouldn’t you like to see a Church rise like that? It’s going to; going back.
   It’s—it’s got to come. That’s right. It’s go-…It’s on its road now, I believe.
   
    My heart cried out when he said that. He said, "Well, there is one on the road."
   Now, if you were on a road toward a destination, you wouldn't have been arriving there, would
   you? You’d only be on the destination to that.
    But I believe when Brother Branham said in Church Order "Little did the people realize that
   that was more tremendous than what they thought, because without Bible order and Bible
   government and every person in the Body of Christ finding their position…." The Bible said,
   "Obey those that have the rule over you." And it says, "God gave apostles, prophets, evangelists,
   pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the saints." God never did take that out of there.
   Ephesians 4:11-14-Reference quote:
   11 And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors

   9 We believe in church government. And the government is ordered of the Holy Spirit in the
   Bible. The pastor is always the head of the church, the pastor is always. That’s God’s elder. In
   organizations, you have to come through the bishop. Now, the Bible… there’s no higher order
   in the Bible than the elder of the church. Just tell me where it’s at. There’s no higher order in
   the Bible for the church than the elder, which is the pastor. He’s the highest order of the
   Bible. And then, if the—the elder, if… Don’t receive any accusation against your elder, unless it
   first be by two or three witnesses; no matter what anybody says about an elder, don’t you believe
   it until you have two or three witnesses. And let them witnesses be tried first. And then if that
   elder has done something wrong and these three Holy Ghost witnesses has been tried and
   proved that they’ve really done something to the elder, then go to the elder, and that sin,
   openly rebuke. See, that others might see and take heed. 10 Now, in order to the church… And

   what? Some of your own ideas. You’re going to have to sacrifice some time in prayer. You’re
   going to have to sacrifice your… maybe a stubborn will, to break down in humility. See? You’re

   304 Let’s turn to Ephesians 4, and find out over here what, in the Book of Ephesians, it says
   about this thing, too, about how we should—how we should do. Ephesian, the 4th chapter, and
   begin with the 12th verse. Ephesians 4, and begin with the 12th verse. All right. Let’s begin up
   here at the 11th verse. And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets;…305 Remember last
   night? Don’t try to take the other man’s office. See? …and some, evangelists; and some,
   pastors…and some, teachers; 306 “For the perfecting of God”? Does it read like that?
   (Congregation says, “No.) The perfection of what? “Saints.” Who are the saints? The sanctified
   ones. Amen. The ones started from down here. …perfecting of the saints, for the working of the
   ministry (the ministry of Jesus Christ), for the edifying of the body of Christ (for the edifying,
   building It up, edifying): until… Till we all come in to the unity of the faith, and…the
   knowledge of the Son of God, and to the perfect man, unto the assurance, (oh, my), to the
   measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ:
    Some say, "Well, when that which is perfect is come that which is in part is done away
   with."
   1 Corinthians 13:9-12-Reference quote:
   9 For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.
   10 But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away.
   11 When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when
   I became a man, I put away childish things.
   12 For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then
   shall I know even as also I am known.
   My Friend, apostles and prophets and evangelists, pastors and teachers aren't in part. And you
   think maybe you’re perfect yet and you need to do away with part of the... Maybe you have a
   little gift. And you think, maybe you ought to go and do away with that because you are perfect,
   but you’re not perfect yet. They may be one standing among us that is perfect, but I have not
   arrived to that place yet. So, I’m not going to do away with what little bit the Lord has give
   me. I’m going to hold on to that and believe that He’s going to give me more.
   And the Bible said, that prophesy was given to the Church for edification. Huh? Brother,
   if the Bride ever need edified, it sure does need edified, now. Whatever little ministry the Lord’s
   
   6
   given yea, I pray that God, you will find your position in Christ. And then only will you be
   blessed of God.
   Now, realizing that God has given this Church order, those that are spiritual enough to
   put that into practice, God said that, if you did this, on "Church Order" tape, then there was
   something greater for you. If you fail to do it, then, you would go down. So, with that thought in
   mind, this morning, I’d like for you to...
   Oh, I would like to say this too. I’d like to quote from a recent tape... Now, mind you, I
   never knew nothing about this tape, although I knew there was a tape called, "Why Was
   It Shepherds?” (William M. Branham, December 21, 1964, Tucson, Arizona) yet I didn't know
   what was on it. I had heard it kinda, in a rushed thing, and all I knew was, "Why Was It
   Shepherds?" and why did they come to Bethlehem. That’s about all I remember about it. And it
   never entered my mind.
   So, when God spoke to me in the room waiting upon the Lord this week, he told me
   something. I looked at that, the tenth chapter of John and it just took my breath away; it just
   scared me. I... My heart just got scared and I run in the room and, oh my, I got so excited and I
   just laid down and cried and...
   And I just want to confess to you this morning, God... I ask God to forgive me for not
   loving His sheep, like I ought to. God, it has revolutionized...This message that God give me,
   this morning, has revolutionized my whole being, my whole effort in life.
   Because, after all, wasn't it said by God's servant, that, "After this life is over then all that
   matters is what you have done for someone else?” And, believing that God called me to minister,
   I’ve spent all my time worrying about that ministry, instead of having a burden for God's sheep
   and trying to feed them wherever I could find them.
   So, therefore, God removed me, set me aside and kept warning me supernaturally. Things
   kept happening to me warning me, very terrifying. I wouldn't even tell you about some of the
   things that happened, but I know the Lord's servant knows all about it. And it put fear in my
   heart and I was afraid to go out and do anything.
   So, I’ve been waiting upon the Lord and, you know, I am so thankful to God that He
   loved me enough to set me aside and give me time to wait upon the Lord. And, I don't think any
   minister, whoever he is, or any lay person will ever be a benefit to God until they learn to wait
   upon the Lord.
   You can't.… You say, "Well, I know a brother that is really filled with the Holy Ghost
   and has got love." How about you? He may leave. How about you?
   And that same prophet said, "It is an individual affair, just you and the Lord alone, in a
   world all to yourself." Said, "Everyone that goes in the rapture will have to have this walk," on
   this tape he called, "Why Was It Shepherds?"

   What about all these creeds and things that’s made up amongst men? God never does deal with

   HE PROMISED HE’D SEND THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST, AND HE’D CALL
   A BRIDE WITHOUT SPOT OR WRINKLE. HE PROMISED TO DO IT, HE’LL DO IT.
   Don’t listen to these hireling shepherds, they’ll lead you astray. The Holy Spirit is the
   Shepherd to feed you sheep food from this Word. It always comes by the Shepherd. He is our
   
   8
   Shepherd. Listen to Him, you are the sheep of His fold; IF YOU ARE, YOU HEAR HIS
   VOICE. Not what somebody else says, you hear what He says. A strange voice, you know
   nothing about it.
   Now, if you’ll open your Bibles to the tenth chapter of John. Now, I am going to read that
   in another translation, you just follow along with me. And, may God add the blessing to His
   Word. John, the tenth chapter.
   One of you Brothers get me a little bit of water? The devil has given me a sore throat and
   he sure wouldn't want me to preach this today.
   John 10:1 thru 15-Reading-Reference quote: (Other translation)
    Most assuredly, I am saying to you, he who does not go through the door into the walled
   enclosure for the sheep, but climbs up from some other way, that one is a thief and a robber.
    But he who enters through the door is a shepherd of the sheep.
   To this one the doorkeeper opens and the sheep hear his voice and he personally calls the sheep,
   which are his private possessions, and by name and leads them out.
    Whenever he puts forth all who are his very own, before them he proceeds and the sheep
   follow with him because they know his voice.
    But one belonging to another flock, they will not positively, positively, not follow, but will run
   away from him because they do not know the voice of others.
    This illustration Jesus gave them: but those did not understand, what things they were which
   he was speaking to them.
    Therefore, Jesus said again, most assuredly, I am saying to you, I alone in contradistinction
   to all others, am the door belonging to the sheep.
    All, as many as came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not listen to them.
    I alone am the door: by means of me, if anyone enters, he shall be saved, and shall go in and
   shall go out and shall find food.
    The thief does not come except to steal and to kill and to destroy: I alone came in order that
   they might be possessing life and that they might be possessing it in super abundance, super
   abundance.)
    I alone am the shepherd, the good one; the shepherd, the good one, laid down his life on
   behalf of, instead of the sheep.
    The one who is a paid helper, and not a shepherd, whose very own the sheep are not,
   watches with a discerning eye the wolf as he is coming and sends away the sheep and flees
   because he is a paid helper and it is not a concern to him regarding the sheep, and the wolf
   snatches them and scatters them.
    I alone am the shepherd, the good one, and I know by experience those that are mine and
   those that are mine know me by the experience, by experience, it said.
    Just as the Father knows me and I know the Father...
   All right. Now, we can see here that Jesus is giving the perfect example for the other
   shepherd pastors, ministers, to follow. And He likens any shepherd that will not follow his
   example, he likens them unto a thief and a robber that would try to feed his sheep. He likens
   
   9
   them to a thief and a robber. Jesus said here that all that ever came before him was thieves and
   robbers.
   John 10:8-Reference quote:
   8 All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them.
   Notice, He said He was the Good Shepherd. And that he laid down his life for the
   sheep. Jesus Christ learned obedience by the things, which he suffered. And he took upon
   himself the form of a servant and had no place to lay his head. What an example of a shepherd!
   John 10:11-Reference quote:
   11 I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.
   Luke 9:58-Reference quote:
   58 And Jesus said unto him, Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests; but the Son of
   man hath not where to lay his head.
   And in the End, he was led as a Lamb to the slaughter because of his love for his
   sheep. And he said that he knew them by experience. And he experienced that, before the
   foundation of the world was laid, that in the mind of God, he wanted some children that knew
   what his love was like. Before the world was ever made, he had an experience of giving birth to
   some sheep. And no wonder that he loved them so.

   60-0925 - That Day On Calvary
   William Marrion Branham
   66 Abraham don’t have to wander no more, across the country, seeking a city. The sinner don’t
   have to wonder any more, whether he can be saved or not. The sick man doesn’t have to wonder
   whether he can be healed or not. The opening veil, on that day at Calvary, revealed the Way to
   the total victory. God give us the powers of His Spirit, to live triumphantly over all these
   things; asks us only to believe it. That happened on that day at Calvary. There never was a day
   like it. There never will be one like it. It’s not necessary no more. The price is paid, and we are
   redeemed. Thanks be to God! We are redeemed. There’s no more you have to wonder about.
   There’s no more guessing about it. It’s all took away. The veil pulled back the curtain, and
   we’re set on a highway, not to wonder any more, but to believe and just walk right on. We
   walk right into God’s very Presence. 67 Abraham knew, and others knew, that while they were
   seeking the City, they knowed they were from Somewhere. Something had happened. They were
   living in a paralyzed earth. Earthquakes came. Storms come. Wars and killings! The wolf and the
   lamb fed on one another, or the wolf fed on the lamb, and the lion eats the ox. It don’t look right.
   There’s something wrong. He knew there was something wrong. Men and brother kill brother;
   father kill son, son kill father. There’s something wrong. He’s getting old. He’s dying. He’s
   withering away. Sickness is on him. He’s in bondage. The trees grow, but not immortal. They die.
   The mountains change. The seas dry up. The waters fail. There’s something wrong. And he
   
   10
   sought a place, a City where that didn’t happen no more. He knew, if he could ever get back into
   the Presence of the One that made it right, he could talk it over with Him. 68 Oh, what a
   privilege, sinner, it is, this morning, to know that you got the Way now. That day at Calvary
   opened up the way. For all those patriarchs hunted for and sought for, Calvary gave it to you,
   free. How would you turn it down? How would you turn it down, to join a denomination? How
   would you turn it down, to substitute something for it, the pleasures of the world? Why not
   accept it? THE OPENING VEIL BRINGS A MAN RIGHT BACK INTO THE PRESENCE
   OF GOD, without sin on him, of any kind. And sets a road before him, to the thing that he’s
   seeking for: Heaven, glory, peace, Eternal Life, everything right before him. 69 That day was
   the—the death blow to Satan’s power. It ended everything. 70 And I can see Him there; He
   was Eden’s lamb, from the very first shadow that come of it. 71 When Abel, by faith, offered
   unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, he must have tied a—a grapevine around the
   lamb’s neck, drug him up to the rock. Took a—a rock in his hand, for a lance, and pulled his
   little head back, and chopped and hacked him until he died. And his wool bathed with his own
   blood. He wallowed in his blood. It was a shadow. 72 But on that day at Calvary, there wasn’t a
   lamb of this earth, but it was the Lamb of God, that was dying, wallowing in His Own Blood. He
   was hacked, and chopped, and beat, and spit on, and slammed, and smacked, and everything, by
   the world, and the Blood dropping off of His locks. 73 When Abel’s lamb died, it died, speaking
   in a language that Abel could not understand. It was bleating. 74 And when God’s Lamb died
   that day at Calvary, He spoke in a language that no one understood Him. “My God, My God,
   why has Thou forsaken Me?” It was God’s Lamb, hacked t, chopped up. 75 HE WAS THE
   VERY LAMB THAT ABEL HAD IN MIND, WHEN HE SEEN THE PROMISED SEED OF
   THE WOMAN. HE WAS THE LAMB THAT DANIEL SAW, THAT WAS HEWED OUT OF
   A MOUNTAIN, WITHOUT HANDS. HE WAS THE WHEEL IN THE MIDDLE OF THE
   WHEEL, FOR THE PROPHET. ALL THEY HAD FORESAW WAS MET ON THAT DAY,
   THAT DAY AT CALVARY. THAT BROUGHT THE GREAT THING IN. THAT BROKE
   THE BACK OF SATAN. 76 First, we should seek what that day meant. Second, we should see
   what that day has done for us, now, what it did for us. Now, third, let’s look at what we ought to
   do for that day. What ought we to do? 77 First, we should look into it, for it’s a great day,
   greatest of all the days. Sin price was settled. Satan’s power was broken. 78 And now we want
   to see what we should do in return. Now, in returns, when Jesus died at Calvary, on Calvary that
   day, HE NOT ONLY PAID THE PRICE FOR OUR SINS, BUT HE ALSO PAID THE
   PRICE AND MADE A WAY THAT WE COULD FOLLOW HIM; FOR WE, AS THE
   FALLEN ADAMS THAT’S BEEN REDEEMED. AS THE SPIRIT LED ADAM (THE
   FIRST ADAM) BY THE SPIRIT, THAT HAD CONTROL OF ALL NATURE, THEN WE
   (THE SECOND ADAM), OR THE MEN OF THE EARTH HAS BEEN REDEEMED BY
   CHRIST, from the day of Calvary, can follow Him. Now, when He died at Calvary, He made a
   way. He gave up the Spirit, the Holy Spirit, that sent It back to the earth, for you and I to live by.
   That’s what Calvary means to us, to follow Him.
   And the Father God, the great Father God Spirit, gave unto Jesus gifts and those gifts
   were his sheep. And he said here, "My sheep know My voice and another they will not
   follow.” They will not follow a man that does not love them. They will not follow one who is but
   a hireling shepherd, and is a paid man. But “My sheep know My Voice."

   John 10:27-29-Reference quote:
   27 My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:
   28 And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck
   them out of my hand.
   29 My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out
   of my Father's hand.
   And He said, "I have them in a walled enclosure." Is, that right? He said, "They’re in a
   sheep fold, a walled enclosure." And, God is not going to let His sheep go astray. God has seen
   to it, and has walled his sheep in, from the hireling shepherd and from the man that doesn't love
   His sheep.
   John 10:1-Reference quote: (Other translation)
   Most assuredly, I am saying to you, he who does not go through the door into the walled
   enclosure for the sheep, but climbs up from some other way, that one is a thief and a
   robber.
   Sheepfold-Reference: A “Sheepfold” is a secure walled enclosure in which sheep are penned
   when not out to pasture in care of the shepherd. The sheepfold might be a permanent barnlike enclosure for shelter, an outdoor holding pen with stone walls, or a makeshift barricade of
   briars and cris-crossed pointed sticks. A single narrow opening was provided for entry and exit.
   If there was no secure door or gate, a keeper would guard the entrance or at night sleep
   across it.
   The purpose of the sheepfold was to keep the flock together, keep out wolves or dogs, and to
   make it difficult for thieves or vandals to steal or harm the sheep. A flock of sheep is a very
   valuable but vulnerable asset. A good shepherd knows and loves his sheep and guards them with
   his life against all predators. He keeps his flock together and fetches back any sheep that stray. A
   sheepfold was necessary for the protection of the flock.
   And Jesus cried out here, and cried and said, "All that has ever come before Me was
   thieves and robbers; that had not the sheep’s intention at their heart."
   John 10:8-Reference quote:
   8 All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them.
   No wonder, Paul, the great apostle, cried out in the last day to his servant, Timothy,
   which is a type of the five-fold ministry, today; cried out to Timothy and said to the church up
   there, said, "I have no minister who is likeminded as myself." Paul was a great shepherd. Said,
   "I have no man who is likeminded, that will care for you sheep and not for your wool. Not for
   what you have, but a shepherd like Timothy, who loves you as I love you, as Christ loved
   you. There is none," he said, "for all seek their own way."
   
   12
   Philippians 2:19-21-Reference quote:
   9 But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto you, that I also may be of good
   comfort, when I know your state.
   20For I have no man likeminded, who will naturally care for your state.
   21 For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's.
   No wonder the Bible said, "For all have gone astray, there’s none that seeketh
   God. There’s none that loveth God, no not one." So, we see here that Jesus likens Himself unto
   the Great Shepherd of the sheep.
   Now, He said in Psalms 23... If you’ll open to that, please, or if you want me, I’ll just
   read it.
   Psalm 23-Scripture Reading;
   23 The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.
   2 He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters.
   3 He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.
   4 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art
   with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.
   5 Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with
   oil; my cup runneth over.
   6 Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house
   of the Lord for ever.
   God, the faithful Shepherd said here, "I will lead My sheep into green pastures. I am
   the great Shepherd and I will feed them. He that hungereth and thirst after righteousness shall
   be filled. I am the Shepherd and I will feed my sheep. I’ll lead them into green pastures and
   as..."
   And you can't expect the shepherd... He said that he was like a shepherd, he fed his
   sheep like a shepherd.
   So, how are we going to know how God is? This just said it was a shepherd, he takes his
   sheep and he leads them forth into the hills of Judaea, where there’s green pastures. And then,
   after they have fed themselves sufficiently upon the word of God, then God said here, that he
   would lead them beside still waters.
   Psalm 23:2-Reference quote:
   2 He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters.
   You cannot just eat the Bread of God alone; you’ve got to drink the water of God. And it
   is God, the great Shepherd, that is responsible for leading his sheep to the still waters and to the
   green pastures. He is the Great Shepherd.

   57-0308 - The Good Shepherd Of The Sheep
   William Marrion Branham
   Now, another thing about these sheep, if they have to have a shepherd. And a man, a owner of
   the sheep, when he went to get a shepherd, he had to… He went and searched out till he got the
   best shepherd that could be gotten, because he loved his sheep. And this man must be special
   trained in knowing how to take care of the sheep. He must know the kind of food they eat. You
   know, there’s a lot of sheep food, and there’s a lot of food you give your sheep would kill it. And
   I’m so glad that God was mindful enough of His sheep to get the right kind of Shepherd, the
   Lord Jesus. He knows what sheep food is. And you know what sheep food is? It’s the Word of
   God. “Man shall not live…” May I change that just a little; “Sheep shall not live by bread alone,
   but by every Word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.” The sheep of God are fed by the
   Word of God. The Holy Spirit in you, what makes you the sheep, feeds solemnly on the Word.
   And solely He feeds on the Word. Anything you throw in the pen outside the Word, He will root it
   out to one side and let it lay there. That’s pretty strong. I don’t know whether you know what I’m
   talking about or not. 14 But he will just take sheep food alone. And God selected the great
   Shepherd of the flock, the Lord Jesus, and gave Him all the authority. Now, another thing, before
   he can go to leading his sheep, the sheep has to know the shepherd’s voice. The shepherd…
   Another shepherd could call, that sheep will never listen to him. He will never pay any
   attention to any shepherd but that one. And in the natural realm, if something happens to the
   shepherd and he’s fired or sent away, oh, what a time a sheep raiser has in those countries to
   find someone to take care of these sheep again. He must be gentle. He must be loving. He must
   have a certain kind of voice. Jesus said, “My sheep hear My voice.” And is in other words,
   “My sheep hear My Word; anything outside of It they’ll not follow.”
   And there is no hireling shepherd, there is no thief, or a robber, that will lead you into the
   spiritual things of God and that will tell you and rebuke the spirits from you and tell you what
   you are and where you are going.
   Because,” He said the hireling shepherd is afraid that, if he tells you women to get in
   order and be in subjection to your husbands, that you won't like him anymore and you’ll get him
   out of that position.
   But a real true shepherd, when he sees the wolf come up, he rebukes the wolf and cuts
   him down off of you with the word of God. Then he is talked about, he is lied about, but,
   nevertheless, down in his heart, he is a true shepherd and he must stay true to that calling inside
   of him.
   God said, "All that has ever came before Me was thieves and robbers," that would just let
   you do anything you want to, so that he could get your money. Said, "All that ever came before
   this door was thieves and robbers."

   110 “Oh,” I said, “Lord, make me a sheep, whatever You do!” See? For when the nighttime
   comes, I want to go into the sheepfold. Enter in at the Door, come by the Door. John 17:7 here,
   or—or He said, “I am…” 10:7, rather, He said, “I am the Door to the sheepfold. All that ever
   come before Me is thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not hear them. I am the Door, by Me
   if any man enters in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out and find pasture.”
   
   But He said, "The keeper of the door does not open to a thief and a robber but, he only
   opens the door of prayer... Whatsoever you ask in My Name I will do it. Seek and ye shall find,
   knock and it shall be opened unto you, if you love My sheep."

   17 But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.
   And that same Shepherd said to the other shepherds, "As my heavenly Father sent me, so
   send I you” To My sheep! Not as thieves and robbers.
   John 20:19-21-Reference quote:
   19 Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut
   where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst, and
   saith unto them, Peace be unto you.
   20 And when he had so said, he shewed unto them his hands and his side. Then were the
   disciples glad, when they saw the Lord.
   
   15
   21 Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto you: as my Father hath sent me, even so
   send I you.
   Then, when you come before the door of prayer to the great Shepherd and say, "Lord
   God, your sheep has need of this. Lord, here is my Token, I present It to You. Lord, I ask for
   them. Pour out Your Spirit upon them."
   Psalm 2:7-8-Reference quote:
   7 I will declare the decree: the Lord hath said unto me, Thou art my Son; this day have I
   begotten thee.
   8 Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of

   And, God is obligated to take care of His Word this morning. And I’ve prayed for you
   this week that God will give every one of you the Baptism of the Holy Ghost this morning. Glory

   But, Jesus said, "All that ever came before me was thieves and robbers, that was just
   willing to go on their way." "Oh, it’s all right," just travel around and have a big time. Thieves

   God's sheep. That is a Hireling Shepherd and careth not for the sheep. Think of that. (Break in

   We see the Bride uniting, uniting with the Word. Why? The Word is God. And as the Word…As
   the Bridegroom (being the Word), and the Bride (being the hearer of the Word), They come
   together in a Union. They unite like a wedding. See, They’re getting ready for a wedding, and
   They—They become One. The Word becomes you, you become the Word. Jesus said, “At that
   day you’ll know it. All the Father is, I am; and all I am, you are; and all you are, I am. In that
   day you’ll know that I’m in the Father, Father in Me, I in you, and you in Me.” See? At “that
   day.” What day? This day! We find out the great hidden mysteries of God being revealed. Oh,
   how I like that!
   
   16
   And, God’s the great Shepherd, he’s never satisfied until you receive the Baptism of the
   Holy Ghost. GOD IS NEVER SATISFIED UNTIL YOU RECEIVE THAT EXPERIENCE. He

   63-0606 - Show Us The Father
   William Marrion Branham
   179 Many times, people say Jesus was a Jew. Some of them said He’s half Gentile, half Jew. He
   was neither one. He was God. That’s Who He was. 180 Now remember, when a baby is born,
   any life comes from the male sex. The germ of life comes from the hemoglobin, the blood. And
   
   17
   the blood is…The life is in the blood. The Bible said so. Now the…like the—the—the… 181 It’s
   springtime. And now all the birds are making nests, and they get a nest full of eggs. Now, an old
   mother bird can go out here and make her nest so pretty, and decorate it all up with all kinds of
   feathers. And she can lay a nest full of eggs, and set on them eggs so loyal. Until, she—she could
   turn them, every day, exactly right. And she can hover over them, and—and keep them warm,
   until such a way she won’t…She’ll starve herself to death. She’ll get so poor she can’t get off the
   nest, to go get her something to eat. She can be so loyal to them eggs, to her babies that’s
   coming on! But if that female bird hasn’t been in contact with the male bird, they’ll never hatch.
   She’s got to be in the male. 182 It reminds me of churches today. Sometimes we can build the
   most prettiest church, we got so, and have the best lot of deacons and everything else like that;
   and a big congregation, the mayor of the city, and everybody coming to it, and bragging about it.
   BUT IF THEY HAVEN’T BEEN IN CONTACT WITH THE NEW BIRTH, WITH THE
   MALE, CHRIST, you’ve got a nest full of rotten eggs. They’ll lay there and rot, every one of
   them. 183 What we need today is a good old-fashion nest cleaning, all the way from
   Presbyterians, Baptists, all the way down, Pentecost and all. You’ve got to come in contact with
   Jesus Christ, Life. He is the One. The hen can lay an egg, but it will not hatch unless she’s
   been with the male bird. 184 And God Almighty, God the Father, overshadowed the virgin
   Mary, and created in her womb a Blood cell which brought forth the Son of God without a
   sexual desire. And that Blood was shed at Calvary. Hallelujah! That is the Blood that I trust
   in, tonight, when there’s nothing. “No other fount I know, nothing but the Blood of Jesus.”
   Therefore, the Blood of God saves us. The BLOOD OF GOD BRINGS JESUS CHRIST IN
   OUR MIDST. THE BLOOD OF GOD BRINGS THE HOLY GHOST. Not the blood of a Jew
   or a Gentile; but God’s Own creative Blood. Jesus, the Man, was His Son that He created
   Himself, and God tabernacled in that tabernacle. And God… 185 Law without penalty is not
   law. If you say it’s against the law to run a red light, and no penalty to it, then it isn’t law. 186
   And God’s law has penalty. “In the day you eat thereof, that day you die.” And when man eat
   thereof, there’s not… 187 God could not send another person to take the place. It would be
   unjust again. For me to make this brother die for what this brother done, would be wrong. God
   had to come, Himself. And the only way He could do it, would be come in His Own flesh,
   which was His Own creative body that He made, Himself, that He could suffer death. Amen.
   188 There is the Gospel in the power. That’s God manifested in the flesh, Emmanuel, to take
   away the sins of the world. And in that Blood we trust; not in the Jew or Gentile; but in the
   Blood of God, which was Jesus Christ. That’s the reason He said, “I and My Father are One.
   My Father dwelleth in Me.” It was the Father in Him.

   18 Could you imagine people freezing to death, and I would paint them a picture of a fire. I’d
   say, “Look at the fire burning. Isn’t it warm? Look at the people standing around, warming.”
   But that’s only a picture of something that has been. You’d freeze just the same, looking at the
   picture. What it takes is that fire to be reproduced again for your warmth. AND THE GOSPEL
   THAT WAS IN THAT DAY, IT’S WRITTEN IN THE WORD AS A HISTORY, A PAINTED
   FIRE OF WHAT WAS. ACCEPT THE SAME SEED THAT THEY ACCEPT, AND IT’LL
   BE A LIVING REALITY IN YOU, THAT’LL BRING YOU INTO THE SAME
   
   18
   EXPERIENCE THAT THEY HAD. Say, “Rev. Branham, is that the truth?” ACCORDING TO
   THE WRITINGS OF THE SCRIPTURE, THE GREAT SAINT PAUL SAID, “THE GOSPEL
   COME TO US NOT BY WORD ONLY, BUT THROUGH POWER AND
   DEMONSTRATIONS OF THE HOLY GHOST.” AND WHEN JESUS COMMISSIONED
   THE CHURCH TO GO INTO ALL THE WORLD AND PREACH THE GOSPEL: MARK 16,
   “GO INTO ALL THE WORLD AND PREACH THE GOSPEL TO EVERY CREATURE. HE
   THAT BELIEVETH AND IS BAPTIZED SHALL BE SAVED, AND HE THAT
   BELIEVETH NOT… AND THESE SIGNS SHALL FOLLOW THEM THAT BELIEVE…”
   19 Now, there’s many has a profession that they believe, and today in my church, as in most all
   of our churches, we class a believer as one who is loyal to the church, and comes to church
   regular, and takes a—a place, a position in the church, and helps the church in its financial
   needs. But that’s very contrary to what Jesus said. Jesus didn’t say, “These signs will follow
   them: they’ll take their place in church, and they’ll be loyal members,” and so forth. He never
   said that. BUT HERE’S HIS LAST STATEMENT TO THE CHURCH. LISTEN. “THESE
   SIGNS SHALL FOLLOW THEM THAT BELIEVE: IN MY NAME THEY SHALL CAST
   OUT DEVILS, SPEAK WITH NEW TONGUES, OR TAKE UP SERPENTS, DRINK
   DEADLY THINGS IT’LL NOT HARM THEM. IF THEY LAY THEIR HANDS ON THE
   SICK, THEY SHALL RECOVER.”
   Ezekiel 34:1-5-Scripture Reading;
   1 And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
   2 Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel, prophesy, and say unto them, Thus saith
   the Lord God unto the shepherds; Woe be to the shepherds of Israel that do feed themselves!
   should not the shepherds feed the flocks?
   3 Ye eat the fat, and ye clothe you with the wool, ye kill them that are fed: but ye feed not the
   flock.
   4 The diseased (doesn’t contend for divine healing) have ye not strengthened, neither have ye
   healed that which was sick, neither have ye bound up that which was broken, neither have ye
   brought again that which was driven away, neither have ye sought that which was lost; but with
   force and with cruelty have ye ruled them.
   5 And they were scattered, because there is no shepherd”

   into, Himself, and dwelt in Him. “This is My beloved Son, in Whom I am pleased to dwell in.”
   There is where God tabernacled, brought His Name and placed It upon, Jesus Christ. Therefore,

   Branham, you—you sure are right.” 90 I say, “Now, Mattsson, you don’t believe that, or you’d
   accept It.” 91 “Well, Bro’er Branham, I—I believe what you say is the Truth.” 92 “Then why
   don’t you accept It?” See? Just burn It right down to him. And he—he, then, as soon as he gets
   away, he’s gone. See? 93 But just watch what that man did in his missions over there, just one
   man. Cause, he could send right back to Chicago and pick up Burton and all the rest of them,
   send them over in there like that, and start the work doings. Till, now they’re getting up in the
   tens of thousands, of one little revival. Not a man with gifts, just a man who had enough courage
   to go there and start. What could been done under This? Could been ranking in the millions.
   Sure. We’ve lost that time. That’s what my suggestion would be. 94 Now remember, in doing
   this, you’ll find out, there may be times that you’ll disagree with Brother So-and-so. You’ll
   disagree over here. And remember, as long as you get to the spot, you say, “Well, because he
   don’t believe It just like me, I ain’t going to…” then there is something wrong with you. Is not
   wrong with the other fellow. It’s something wrong with you. When, brethren who are trying to
   hold together! 95 There’s one thing, we Branham’s, there’s nine of us, and we’d fight like pet
   dogs. But, after all, when we got through fighting, we were still Branham’s. One knowed the
   other was a Branham. I knowed he was a Branham. He knowed I was a Branham. See? But we’d
   fight. You do that in your family, but they’re still your brothers. That’s the way it is. We might
   
   20
   different, that’s all right, but we’re still one. We’re one in Christ. We believe this Message, and
   let’s stay with It. 96 And I think that that’s the thing to do, to keep on carrying on, until Jesus
   comes. And that’s what I wanted to say in that manner. And I believe if you’d have like… 97 See,
   you’ve got to be enthused with It. If you’re not enthused, then there is something wrong. There is
   something wrong. You got, just not say, “Well, last month I was pretty well enthused, but I don’t
   know.” See, then there is something wrong somewhere. You’ve got to be enthused, all the time,
   see, and just keep punching. It’s the devil, trying to get you.

   62-0121M - And Thy Seed Shall Possess The Gate Of His Enemy
   William Marrion Branham
   244 Give me a church, give me ten men, who, really jewels of God, the Royal Seed, put them
   men together, and watch what’ll take place. Give me this little houseful of people like that, and
   I’ll show you a Light that the world will run to it. That’s right. That’s what God wants us to
   be. “You’re a city setting on a hill.” You’re Royal Seed of Abraham. “It shall possess the gate
   of its enemy.” 245 Sickness, there’s a cause for sickness. There’s a cause for these things. And
   God, the Holy Spirit, is here to reveal that thing and tell you why you don’t get it. What’s the
   matter with us? We don’t have to wonder, “Will It do it.” It’s already doing it. What do you do?
   246 Watch that prophet. He listened not to the rushing wind, “Glory to God! Hallelujah!” 247
   That’s good. Now, remember, I’m not condemning that. I hope everybody understands that.
   Somebody said, “Brother Branham don’t believe in saying, ‘Glory to God! Hallelujah!’” Well,
   look at me up here now. I believe in shouting, speaking with tongues, dancing in the Spirit. 248
   But, brother, when you fail to hear that still small Voice of the Word, that’s the thing that gets
   you. That’s the thing. 249 Elijah knowed all this revival was going on outside. But he was…It
   never attracted him outside to it. But when he heard that still small Voice of God, then he was
   attracted. And he veiled his face, come out. Why? Elijah was the Seed of Abraham, following the
   Word. 250 “If ye abide in Me and My Words in you, then ask what you will, it’ll be done for
   you.”
   Ezekiel 34:6-10-Scripture Reading;
   6 My sheep wandered through all the mountains, and upon every high hill: yea, my flock was
   scattered upon all the face of the earth, and none did search or seek after them.
   7 Therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of the Lord;
   8 As I live, saith the Lord God, surely because my flock became a prey, and my flock became
   meat to every beast of the field,
   (All these denominational churches and independent churches. Beast of the field.)
   because there was no shepherd, neither did my shepherds search for my flock, but the shepherds
   fed themselves, and fed not my flock;
   9 Therefore, O ye shepherds, hear the word of the Lord;
   10 Thus saith the Lord God; Behold, I am against the shepherds; and I will require my flock at
   their hand, and cause them to cease from feeding the flock; neither shall the shepherds feed
   themselves any more; for I will deliver my flock from their mouth, that they may not be meat for
   them.
   11 For thus saith the Lord God; Behold, I, even I, will both search my sheep, and seek them out.
   
   21
   12 As a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep that are scattered;
   so will I seek out my sheep, and will deliver them out of all places where they have been
   scattered in the cloudy and dark day.
   The Bible said, there was a day at evening time, it was not light or day, but was a cloudy
   day. "BUT IN THE EVENING TIME IT SHALL BE LIGHT."
   Zechariah 14:6-7-Reference quote:
   6 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the light shall not be clear, nor dark:
   7 But it shall be one day which shall be known to the Lord, not day, nor night: but it shall
   come to pass, that at evening time it shall be light.
   And God would come down on the earth with the great Pillar of Fire and seek out and
   search out His sheep.
    Now over in the 26th verse.
   Ezekiel 34:26,27-Scripture Reading
   26 And I will make them and the places round about my hill a blessing; and I will cause the
   shower to come down in his season; there shall be showers of blessing.
   27 And the tree of the field shall yield her fruit, and the earth shall yield her increase, and they
   shall be safe in their land, and shall know that I am the Lord, when I have broken the bands of
   their yoke, and delivered them out of the hand of those that served themselves of them.
   My, what a passage of Scripture! God, in the evening time by the light of the Word of
   God, has restored the apostolic Word of God, has restored unto us what was taken away from us,
   that which the palmerworm hath eaten and all the others, that same worm we know that was
   ecclesiasticism.

   An Exposition Of The Seven Church Ages - 10 - A Resume Of The Ages
   William Marrion Branham
   This age started just after the turn of the twentieth century. As it was to be the age in which the
   true church would return to being the bride she was at Pentecost, we know that there must of
   necessity be a return of dynamic power. The believers sensed this in their spirits and began
   crying to God for a new outpouring such as was in the first century. What seemed to be the
   answer came as many began to speak in tongues and manifest gifts of the Spirit. It was then
   believed that this was indeed the long awaited RESTORATION. It was not, for the latter rain
   can come only after the former rain which is the spring or TEACHING rain. The latter rain,
   then, is the HARVEST rain. How could this be the real thing when the Teaching Rain had not
   come? THE PROPHET-MESSENGER WHO WAS TO BE SENT TO TEACH THE PEOPLE
   AND TURN THE HEARTS OF THE CHILDREN BACK TO THE PENTECOSTAL
   FATHERS HAD NOT YET COME. THUS WHAT WAS THOUGHT TO BE THE
   RESTORATION AND THE FINAL QUICKENING UNTO THE RAPTURE HAD NOT
   
   22
   COME. In it was a mixture of the unrighteous partaking of Spiritual blessing and manifesting in
   the Holy Ghost as we have kept pointing out to you. In it also was devil power as men were
   under the control of devils, yet no one seemed to realize it. Then, to prove that it was not the
   REAL, these people (even before a second generation had appeared) organized, and wrote their
   unscriptural doctrines and built their own fences as every other group ahead of them did.
   Remember, while Jesus was upon earth so was Judas. Each came from a different spirit, and
   upon death each went to his own place. The Spirit of Christ later came back upon the true
   church, and the spirit of Judas came back upon the false church. It is right there in Revelation
   6:2-8, “And I saw, and behold a white horse; and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown
   was given unto him: and he went forth conquering and to conquer. And when he had opened the
   second seal, I heard the second beast say, Come and see. And there went out another horse that
   was red: and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they
   should kill one another: and there was given unto him a great sword. And when he had opened
   the third seal, I heard the third beast say, Come and see. And I beheld, and lo a black horse; and
   he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand. And I heard a voice in the midst of the four
   beasts say, A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and see
   that thou hurt not the oil and the wine. And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice
   of the fourth beast say, Come and see. And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that
   sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him. And power was given him over the fourth part
   of the earth, to kill with the sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the
   earth.” See how that Judas spirit came back as a rider on a white horse. It was white. So close to
   the real, just as Judas was so close to Jesus. A crown was given to him (white horse rider). How?
   That spirit was now in the leader of the Nicolaitane system and he was a triple crowned pope
   who sat as God in his temple, calling himself the vicar of Christ. If vicar of Christ means
   “instead of Christ” or “in place of” or “on behalf of God” then the pope was calling himself the
   Holy Ghost, or deposing the Holy Ghost, acting for Him. That was the Judas spirit in him doing
   that. See how he conquered — going forth conquering and to conquer. Christ did not do that.
   The only ones that came to Him were already predestinated by the Father. And so on and on
   went that spirit and one day it will become truly incarnate in a man who will head up the World
   Council of Churches, just as we have been saying. And by his gold (remember Judas held the
   bag) he will control the whole world, and that antichrist system will own everything and try to
   control everybody. But Jesus will come back and destroy them all with the brightness of His
   coming. And their end will be the lake of fire. But what about the true seed? It will happen just
   as we have said. The people of God are being made ready by the Word of Truth from the
   messenger to this age. In her will be the fulness of Pentecost for the Spirit will bring the
   people right back to where they were at the beginning. That is “Thus saith the Lord.” It is
   “Thus saith the Lord” for that is what Joel 2:23-26 says, “Be glad then, ye children of Zion,
   and rejoice in the Lord your God: for He hath given you the former rain moderately, and He
   will cause to come down for you the rain, the former rain, and the latter rain in the first
   month. And the floors shall be full of wheat, and the fats shall overflow with wine and oil.
   AND I WILL RESTORE TO YOU THE YEARS THAT THE LOCUST HATH EATEN, THE
   CANKERWORM, AND THE CATERPILLAR, AND THE PALMERWORM, MY GREAT
   ARMY WHICH I SENT AMONG YOU. AND YE SHALL EAT IN PLENTY, AND BE
   SATISFIED, AND PRAISE THE NAME OF THE LORD YOUR GOD, THAT HATH
   DEALT WONDROUSLY WITH YOU: AND MY PEOPLE SHALL NEVER BE ASHAMED.”
   Now it says God is going to “restore.” The Lutheran Age did not restore the church; it started a
   
   23
   reformation. The Weslyan Age did not restore. The Pentecostal Age did not restore. But God has
   to restore for He cannot deny His Word. This is not the resurrection of the Church; it is the
   “Restoration.” God will take the Church right back to Pentecost of the beginning. Now notice
   in verse 25 it tells why we need restoration. The locust, cankerworm, caterpillar and
   palmerworm have eaten all but the root and a small bit of the stem. Now we are told that all
   these insects are all one and the same in different stages. That is right. They are the antichrist
   spirit manifested in organization, denomination and false doctrine through the ages. AND
   THAT POOR LITTLE ROOT AND STALK IS GOING TO BE RESTORED. GOD ISN’T
   GOING TO PLANT A NEW CHURCH, BUT IS GOING TO BRING HIS ORIGINAL
   PLANTING BACK TO ORIGINAL SEED. He is doing it as stated in verse 23, by the teaching,
   or “former” rain. Next will come the harvest rain OR RAPTURING FAITH.
   God promised that in the evening time He would seek out His sheep, find them and
   gather them together and send shepherds to them, then. Is, that right?
   Now, Zechariah 10:1-5-Scripture Reading;
   10 Ask ye of the Lord rain in the time of the latter rain; so the Lord shall make bright clouds, and
   give them showers of rain, to every one grass in the field.
   2 For the idols have spoken vanity, and the diviners have seen a lie, and have told false dreams;
   they comfort in vain: therefore they went their way as a flock, they were troubled, because there
   was no shepherd.
   3 Mine anger was kindled against the shepherds, and I punished the goats: for the Lord of hosts
   hath visited his flock the house of Judah, and hath made them as his goodly horse in the battle.
   4 Out of him came forth the corner, out of him the nail, out of him the battle bow, out of him every
   oppressor together.
   5 And they shall be as mighty men, which tread down their enemies in the mire of the streets in
   the battle: and they shall fight, because the Lord is with them, and the riders on horses shall be
   confounded.
   Think of that! A perfect type of the 2nd chapter of Joel. After the restoration of the word
   came, the Bride of Jesus Christ rose up like a mighty army. Is, that right? After the restoration!
   Now, Jeremiah 23, I Got a lot of Scripture for you this morning. Jeremiah 23:1-3
   Jeremiah 23:1-3-Scripture Reading;
   23 Woe be unto the pastors that destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture! saith the Lord. 2 Therefore thus saith the Lord God of Israel against the pastors that feed my people; Ye have
   scattered my flock, and driven them away, and have not visited them: behold, I will visit upon
   you the evil of your doings, saith the Lord. 3 And I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all countries whither I have driven them, and
   will bring them again to their folds; (I want to emphasize that there, (Bring them again to their
   folds, F-O-L-D-S) and they shall be fruitful and increase.
   Jesus Christ said, over here in the 10th chapter of John, that I... "Verily, verily, I say unto
   you, he that entereth not by the door to the sheepfold..."
   
   24
   John 10:1-5-Scripture Reading;
   1 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but
   climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.
   2 But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.
   3 To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by
   name, and leadeth them out.
   4 And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for
   they know his voice.
   5 And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of
   strangers.
   And that, in the Greek, is a walled enclosure. And there is only one door into that
   sheepfold and that’s Jesus. Is, that right? Only one door to that sheepfold, which is a walled
   enclosure.
   And it said here, in the last days because of the denominational pastors and preachers that
   was trying to feed God's flock. He said, in the end time that he would bring his sheep into their
   folds and they would be fruitful and increase. Is, that right? Then, he said when he got them into
   his fold, he would feed them and water them. Is, that right?
   So, we find out then that this fold here...I looked that up in the Hebrew word, and found a
   striking thing, that this fold represents different assemblies. It means five things: a hedge or a
   wall...
   Now, notice Jesus just said, in the 10th chapter of John, about the hireling shepherds that
   he had his sheep in a walled enclosure. Is, that right? Hooks up then, don't it?
   Number two, it means a home of God. Think of that, boy! Bring them to their folds; it
   means a home of God, a hedge or a wall, a temple of men, a habitation of God, a pleasant place.
   Think of it! THAT GOD, AFTER YOU HAVE SEARCHED OUT IN THE LAND, IN
   AND OUT OF EVERY KIND OF CHURCH, AND FINALLY IN THE END TIME, HE
   WOULD ESTABLISH DIFFERENT ASSEMBLIES AND THERE WOULD BE A
   PLEASANT PLACE; THERE WOULD BE A HABITATION OF GOD; THERE WOULD BE
   A TEMPLE OF GOD; THERE WOULD BE A HOME OF GOD.
   And in there, where the true shepherds would feed you the word of God, you would
   grow fat, in and out of green pastures. You would come in and out, into higher heights, into
   deeper depths, into more revelation. Because that true shepherd that was over you, your true
   pastor, prayed and went up into the spiritual realm and found green pastures for you. And then he
   fed you the word of God and you grew fat and you began to be fruitful.
   In that day, when God will bring His sheep into these assemblies and establish pastors
   over them, then you’ll have a home of God, then you’ll be a temple of God. Is, that right? Then
   you’ll be a... The Bible said, you were a spiritual temple, you were a spiritual house. Is, that
   right? You were a holy habitation. How pleasant it is for the sheep to dwell in a place like
   that. How pleasant it is!
   
   25
   1 Peter 2:4-8-Reference quote:
   4 To whom coming, as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, and
   precious,
   5 Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual
   sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.
   6 Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect,
   precious: and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded.
   7 Unto you therefore which believe he is precious: but unto them which be disobedient, the stone
   which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner,
   8 And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence, even to them which stumble at the word, being
   disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed.
   Notice, Christ was born in Bethlehem, which means, "The house of God's bread." And it
   said here, that this sheepfold was a house of God's bread. Is, that right? And only God-ordained
   shepherds was able to enter into that door to that sheepfold. Is, that right?
   Oh, there have been a lot of thieves and robbers came up and tried to start different
   works, tried to start different assemblies. But, they only did it because they wanted to be a pastor
   and have a good job and have an income coming in. So, therefore, they didn't feed the sheep
   because, they loved the money.

   An Exposition Of The Seven Church Ages - 4 - The Smyrnaean Church Age
   William Marrion Branham
   All over the world in both Pentecostal and fundamental groups they are organizing the
   businessmen. They have invaded the pulpit without a call from God. They have styled
   themselves the fishers of men and the founders of a move of God, and they say the gifted ministry
   of Ephesians 4:10-13 that God gave the church has failed, so they are taking over. Here we are
   right in the midst of the fulfillment of prophecy, called the gainsayings of Korah, and they don’t
   even know that they have fulfilled it. They are blindly going on preaching experience for truth.
   May God have pity on them. May their eyes be opened before it is too late. Oh, listen to me.
   When did the prestige of money, social leadership, business ability, or sheer mental prowess
   ever qualify a man for spiritual leadership, or give any weight to the Word of God? And when
   in any way materiality or human values begin to show as the media by which God works instead
   of the Holy Spirit ALONE, then we are fighting against God, not for Him.

   47-1123 - The Children Of Israel
   William Marrion Branham
   45 Notice. Then when he said that, said he could only speak what God put in his mouth. And God
   told him to send them back. And he… Notice. Then Balaam, like a lot of hireling prophets now,
   for usury, for money, he come back again and asked him the second time. And he went to God
   again. Now look. There is a perfect will of God, and there’s a permissive will of God. And God
   permitted His prophet to go on, yet he… It wasn’t His perfect will. It was His permissive will.
   And I feel this afternoon is the same thing on these—working these—this—for this miracle line. It
   
   26
   is God’s, maybe, permissive will, but it’s not His perfect will. You are supposed to take my word,
   and if—if…
   
   Jesus said, all that ever came before me was shepherds like that that just cared about the
   tithes and offerings, let the women do anything they want to. They wouldn't preach subjection to
   the women. They wouldn't preach, "Everybody get in Bible order." They wouldn't preach Church
   Order. They just want to be a hireling shepherd and let the wolf spirits come in and settle upon
   the people. The demons come in and get upon the people. And then the hireling shepherds don't
   have enough faith of God to stand out on the Word of God and rebuke them off of you….
   But not a real true shepherd… will tell you what is what. He’ll preach the Word of God,
   he don't care what happens to you. He don't care if there is only one shepherd standing on it, he’ll
   be the one that’ll stand on it.
   But a hireling shepherd, well, when something comes up and he feels like running to
   Arizona, or running here, running there, he’ll just run off and leave his sheep. The only thing he
   cared about you anyways, is because of your tithes and offerings.
   NOT A REAL TRUE SHEPHERD. HE’LL STAY THERE AND CONTEND FOR THE
   WORD OF GOD. HE’LL SAY, "GOD, YOU PROMISED THIS RESTORATION OF THE
   WORD. GOD, YOU PROMISED AN APOSTOLIC CHURCH. GOD, YOU SAID YOU
   WOULD SEND IT. GOD, YOU SAID YOU WOULD GIVE US A PENTECOST. AND HE
   PREACHES THAT FAITH TO THE PEOPLE AND THEIR FAITH RISES AND IT RISES
   UNTIL THEY GET THE SAME THING THAT FELL ON THE DAY OF PENTECOST.
   Not a hireling shepherd, though. Every time them spirits come in on the people he’ll run
   from them, then. When it gets too hot for him, he’ll just leave them, find another flock.
   God said, shepherds that had come up another way than the door…. And the door is
   Jesus. And Jesus was a Shepherd of faith. He said, "It is written.” “It is written.” “It is
   written.” “It is written." Not a hireling shepherd.
   God said they’re like a thief that’ll climb over that wall, try to get down in there to His
   sheep. GOD IS NOT GONNA LET IT BE THAT WAY, IN THIS DAY! He’s not gonna let any
   of them hireling shepherds climb over that wall. Because you’re a thief and you are a robber,
   shepherd, this morning, if you don't stand for the Word of God. Glory to God!

   William Marrion Branham
   209 How you going to build your church upon the Rock? How will the preacher ever stand in
   the pulpit and preach the Rock, and build it upon the fundamentals of the full Gospel, when
   his audience, some of his people out there, would put him out? Now, I blame the preacher for
   not having the audacity, and the Spirit of God, for just shutting the door, say, “Get somebody
   else will stand for that stuff and not me.” I—I admire a preacher that would do that. 210 But
   woe unto that congregation when an anointed man of God tries to bring them the Word, and
   then they won’t line up with It. That’s right. How is he going to have a church that all the nine
   gifts operating in it, and so forth, and then, they and that, and the church won’t even—even live
   decently and morally, won’t learn their ABC’s of the Gospel? Then say, “If I had a better

   55 God giving me my right mind and let me stand and preach that Gospel and believe that
   Gospel in the power of the resurrection of Christ. I’ll either stand for right or forfeit my way and
   go back. Yes, sir. Got to preach the Gospel, stand for what’s right. What we need today is some
   more of those old fashion, stirring preachers that used to travel the land with a little suitcase
   in their hand, preach the Gospel. GOT TOO MUCH LITTLE SISSIES TODAY TRYING TO
   DO IT. WHAT WE NEED IS THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST BACK AGAIN. 56
   “What taken place, Brother Branham?” The Holy Ghost took It’s flight when you started. First
   thing you know, you say, “Now, if Suzy, you know that… Well, I’ll never go back no more.”
   Away goes the Holy Ghost, took Its flight. It ain’t going to stand on you snorting and carrying on
   like that. You know that. It’s a Lover and It’s meek. And if you want to get the Holy Spirit to stay
   on you… “Brother Branham, what’s the formula? How do we get back?” Nothing at all, but
   just become a lamb, get that old, worldly thing away from you. Get the old, goaty spirit off of
   you. Get the Lamb back to you, and the Holy Spirit will come right back to the Lamb. ’Cause
   the dove and the lamb is the only two can live together, because their spirits is alike. 57 God
   hates sin. And how is God, the Holy Spirit, going to live in a person that’s always committing
   sins, going out deliberately, doing this and that, running to these kind of places. That’s what’s
   the matter with the church. YOU SAY, “WELL, BROTHER BRANHAM, I SPOKE IN
   TONGUES.” I DON’T CARE WHAT YOU DONE. IF YOUR LIFE DON’T TYPE UP WITH
   GOD’S BIBLE… I’VE SEEN WITCHES AND WIZARDS SPEAK IN TONGUES. I’VE
   SEEN THEM DANCE IN THE SPIRIT AND EVERYTHING ELSE. AMERICA’S ROTTEN
   WITH THAT TOMMYROT. I believe in speaking in tongues. I believe in every gift the Bible
   said in here. I believe it. But it’s got to be put in its right place and carried on at the right way,
   at the right time. And God will vindicate every bit of it to be the truth. Right. 58 And now, I don’t
   mean to be rude. I don’t mean that. I just don’t mean for to hurt you, my friends. But I mean to
   be honest with you. Yes, sir. 59 Someone, years ago when I first started preaching, they said,
   “BILLY, YOU PREACH THAT AND YOUR CHURCH WILL BE TORE UP.” I SAID, “ANY
   CHURCH THAT’S TORE UP BY OLD FASHIONED GOSPEL PREACHING OUGHT TO
   BE TORE UP.” THAT’S RIGHT. THAT’S EXACTLY RIGHT. I SAID, “I’D PREACH IT IF
   I HAVE TO LAY ON MY STOMACH AND DRINK BRANCH WATER AND EAT SODA
   CRACKERS EVERY DAY OF MY LIFE AND PREACH TO A FOUR PILLAR POST IN
   THE CHURCH.” I’D RATHER DO IT AND TELL THE TRUTH AND HAVE FAVOR

   He knows His sheep. That true shepherd, He said, "I am the porter to the door." The
   porter openeth the door for the true shepherd, then he’ll lead his sheep out with that true
   shepherd.

   John 10:2-5-Reference quote:
   2 But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.
   3 To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by
   name, and leadeth them out.
   4 And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him:
   for they know his voice.
   5 And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of
   strangers.
   Then he’ll take that shepherd to listen to the message of the hour, then that shepherd will
   begin to preach the word of God. He’ll begin to lay that thing down there to them
   sheep. They’ll... Oh! They will be rocked to and fro but, finally, the word of God keeps coming
   forth, boy, they get settled down. Oh! They’re gettin like standing on the rock. Is, that right?
   The Bible said, "Don't be tossed to and fro by every wind that comes off from the
   tape. Don't be tossed to and fro by every interpretation that comes from the tapes.
   Ephesians 4:13-15-Reference quote
   13 Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a
   perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:
   14 That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every
   wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to
   deceive;
   15 But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even
   Christ:
   Listen to your shepherd that God put over you! He’ll lead you and guide you into all the
   green pastures and lead you beside the still waters." Because the great Shepherd, Jesus, gives
   him a revelation of what’s on the tapes and what’s in the word of God.
   I say to you this morning, there is no person that is in the laity, is not able to interpret
   God's inspiration of the Holy Ghost, the word of God, it has to come to shepherds. God brought
   the revelation by angels to shepherds and they went to Bethlehem. Shepherds! He didn't find the
   laity and send them. He sent shepherds to Bethlehem. And the shepherds found Jesus in the
   house of God's bread. Oh, boy! Glory!
   A home of God, temple of men. It’s assembly, now. Come on! A pleasant place. How
   pleasant it is to dwell with brethren and sisters of like precious faith and kindred mind, that’s
   contending for the faith that was once delivered to the saints of God.
   Well, “Bethlehem” means “the house of God's bread.” And the Divine angels,
   ministering spirits, He said, "I will make my ministers, ministering spirits and flames of
   fire." Why, if they get a revelation, brethren, they don't care if there ain't nobody stands on it,
   they’ll stand on it, they got to do it. They got to do it!
   Hebrews 1:7-Reference quote:
   7 And of the angels he saith, Who maketh his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.

   God loves His sheep and God predestinated them shepherds. And God loves you and
   he’ll finally lead you to them, someday. The hour is at hand, Church order has been set in
   position. Bible government is in order, now. You may not find it very many places. Maybe only
   one or two places, but shall the unbelief of others make void the faith of God of
   Abraham? No! God will only establish it.
   Romans 4:13-16-Reference quote:
   13 For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not to Abraham, or to his seed,
   through the law, but through the righteousness of faith.
   14 For if they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none
   effect:
   15 Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, there is no transgression.
   16 Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all
   the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham;
   who is the father of us all,
   It was always a little group that God used to contend for Pentecost. We found it only fell
   on an hundred and twenty. We find that every time revival started, he only took one man, only
   took one little group.

   12 However, God always makes a—a way for His Church. When He’s finished with one man,
   He has another one waiting. And God takes His man, but never His Spirit. He always got
   somebody else He can put His Spirit on. And it’s strange, but through the Bible, He never had
   two prophets, major prophets in operation at the same time. He always had one prophet. Then
   when He got through with that one, He—taken him away and put another one in his place. 13
   That’s what He had did. He’d just change messengers, but the same Spirit: Elijah and Elisha.

   64-0401 - The Identified Christ Of All Ages
   William Marrion Branham
   49 Each time He appeared on the earth, at the end of an age, He always sent a man and anoint
   him with the Holy Ghost, Christ. The Holy Ghost is Christ, “the anointed,” the Logos, and It
   went out, and It comes to identify the—the Words of that age. “The Word of the Lord comes to
   the prophets,” the Bible said so, and identifies that age. See, He does nothing outside of man.
   Now He can’t do it in a group. You can’t do it. It just never has been done. He never did use a
   group; never did. He uses one single person. You’re not… 50 Israel was saved as a nation, but
   you’re going to be saved as an individual. 51 And one person He deals with. He had a…He
   didn’t even have a—a—a Moses and Elijah, the same time. He couldn’t have Elijah and Elias,
   the same time. He couldn’t have John and Jesus, the same time. He has always got one, because
   He gets that one person into His Divine will.
   When the Holy Spirit fell, out in California, it fell in the most obscure place, fell right
   down in the middle of the city. Fell right down in a little old teeny building; floors caved in and
   everything. Is, that right? BUT THEY BELIEVED THAT GOD HAD GIVEN THEM THE
   SECRET OF THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST.
   And they said, "Why there ain't been an Outpouring in years and years. Oh! God don't really
   mean that. God don't really mean that. He means for you to do this and that." No, God said, that
   they went in the Upper Room and received the Holy Ghost. And we ain't got what they had.
   Acts 2:1-6-Reference quote:
   1 And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place.
   2 And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all
   the house where they were sitting.
   3 And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them.
   4 And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the
   Spirit gave them utterance.
   5 And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven.
   6 Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded,
   because that every man heard them speak in his own language.
   I don't care how obscure this building looks, this morning, over top of the Burger Inn. I
   don't care if it is in New York City and down here in the middle of town, God is going to take
   something foolish like this and give them another Pentecost, he promised he’s going to do it.
   Now, if I be a true servant of Christ and if that don't come to pass you come and tell me
   about it. But when it comes to pass, won't be no use for me to say, "Didn't I tell you
   so?" Because it shall most surely come to pass. There shall be an apostolic Church in New York
   
   31
   City. There shall be! There shall be! God promised it. He just has to find two or three that’ll
   believe it. I believe you’ll believe it. God always used a place like that.
   When the prophet of God, the restoration Message, has gave out the word of God and
   restored... Let me just read that to you. Everybody reads about Elijah but they don't read the rest
   of it. Let me read you the rest of it, to you.
   Well, says here that... Said that, "There’ll be a prophet rise with healing in his wings." Is,
   that right? Restoration prophet. And he said, "Ye sheep shall go forth and grow up as calves of
   the stall," sheep of the stall.
   Why? When you come in to... Sheep, when they came into the walled enclosure, the
   manger, the habitation of God, a pleasant place for them, they’re not fearing any longer; they
   know they’re in the will of God and the Spirit is a blessing, so they’re in pleasant places. They’re
   sitting in heavenly places with Christ Jesus, fellowshipping among the saints of God. Is, that
   right?
   Knowing that Jesus, the word of God, is on the earth now and, God… It is just a matter
   of our faith rising up and God is going to pour out the Holy Ghost. Is, that right? And he said
   when God would bring these calves into these stalls...
   Malachi 4:2-Reference quote:
   2 But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his
   wings; and ye shall go forth, and grow up as calves of the stall.
   Well, you can't expect a true shepherd to bring his sheep into the stall for the night and
   not have provender in the manger, can you? And God, if he’s provided the corn, he’ll also
   provide the water to water you down with the Holy Ghost, too. For, it’s God that supplieth all
   things.
   No wonder, Paul said about the Hebrews, he said, how about... "Moses was faithful in all
   his house." And he said, "The one that builds the house, is greater than the house." And if God is
   building you up a house, don't you know that he is wanting to put the roof on the house
   now? He’s waiting to cap it with the Headstone. It’s him that does it. You just got to believe that
   you’re part of that house and just wait for the lid to come down.
   Hebrews 3:3-6-Reference quote:
   3 For this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who hath builded
   the house hath more honour than the house.
   4 For every house is builded by some man; but he that built all things is God.
   5 And Moses verily was faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things
   which were to be spoken after;

   the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end.

   An Exposition Of The Seven Church Ages - 5 - The Pergamean Church Age
   William Marrion Branham
   Whatever seed started the church will come forth and be like the original seed because it is the
   same seed. IN THESE LAST DAYS THE TRUE BRIDE CHURCH (CHRIST’S SEED) WILL
   COME TO THE HEADSTONE, AND SHE WILL BE THE SUPER CHURCH, A SUPER
   RACE, AS SHE NEARS HIM. THEY IN THE BRIDE WILL BE SO MUCH LIKE HIM
   THAT THEY WILL EVEN BE IN HIS VERY IMAGE. THIS IS IN ORDER TO BE
   UNITED WITH HIM. THEY WILL BE ONE. THEY WILL BE THE VERY
   MANIFESTATION OF THE WORD OF THE LIVING GOD. Denominations cannot produce
   this (wrong seed). They will produce their creeds and their dogmas, mixed with the Word. This
   mongrelizing brings forth a hybrid product. The first son (Adam) was the spoken seed-Word of
   God. He was given a bride to reproduce himself. That is why the bride was given to him, to
   reproduce himself; to produce another son of God. But she fell. She fell by hybridization. She
   caused him to die. The second Son (Jesus), also a spoken Seed-Word of God was given a bride
   like as was Adam. But before He could marry her, she also had fallen. She, like Adam’s wife,
   was put to the test whether she would believe the Word of God and live, or doubt the Word and
   die. She doubted. She left the Word. She died. From a little group of the true seed of the Word,
   God will present Christ with a beloved bride. She is a virgin of His Word. She is a virgin
   because she knows no man-made creeds or dogmas. By and through the members of the bride
   will be fulfilled all that was promised of God to be made manifest in the virgin. The word of
   promise came to the virgin Mary. But that Word of promise was He, Himself, to be made
   manifest. God was made manifest. He, Himself, acted at that time and fulfilled His own Word
   of promise in the virgin. It was an angel that had brought her the message. But the angel’s
   message was the Word of God. Isaiah 9:6. He fulfilled at that time all that was written of Him
   because she accepted His Word to her. The members of the virgin bride will love Him, and
   they will have His potentials, for He is their head, and all power belongs to Him. They are
   subject to Him as the members of our bodies are subject to our heads. Notice the harmony of the
   Father and the Son. Jesus never did anything until it was first showed Him by the Father. John
   5:19. This harmony is now to exist between the Groom and His bride. He shows her His Word
   of life. She receives it. She never doubts it. Therefore, nothing can harm her, not even death.
   For if the seed be planted, the water will raise it up again. Here is the secret of this. The Word
   is in the bride (as it was in Mary). The bride has the mind of Christ for she knows what He
   wants done with the Word. She performs the command of the Word in His name for she has
   “thus saith the Lord.” Then the Word is quickened by the Spirit and it comes to pass. Like a
   seed that is planted and watered, it comes to full harvest, serving its purpose. Those in the bride
   do only His will. No one can make them do otherwise. They have “thus saith the Lord” or they
   keep still. They know that it has to be God in them doing the works, fulfilling His own Word. He
   did not complete all His work while in His earthly ministry so now He works in and through
   the bride. She knows that, for it was not yet time for Him to do certain things that He must now
   do. But He will now fulfill through the bride that work which He left for this specific time.
   
   Because, while Peter yet spake these words the roof come down. While Peter yet spake
   these words the Holy Ghost fell. Yes, it did.
   
   33
   Acts 10:44-Reference quote:
   44 While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word.
   All right now, we find that only God-ordained shepherds was led to that shepherd manger
   in Bethlehem. And each one of them shepherds had got a divine revelation and angel spirits had
   come and sung out the message to them and they alone had the true interpretation to it. Is, that
   right? All right.
   They, by faith, set in Church order... Did they do it by faith? All right, I’ll tell you what
   God said he would do after you put in Church order, just reading on about the Elijah restored,
   now in Malachi. Restoration prophet. Said… Jesus said, "Return unto me, return unto me, the
   word, and I will return unto you." God promised, if you’d return to this word that the restoration
   prophet brought, he would return again into your midst. Because, the word is spirit and Jesus
   Christ, God Almighty, is that spirit and the word is Jesus Christ.
   Malachi 3:7-Reference quote:
   7 Even from the days of your fathers ye are gone away from mine ordinances, and have not kept
   them. Return unto me, and I will return unto you, saith the Lord of hosts. But ye said, Wherein
   shall we return?
   When you preach the Word of God by faith to the sheep, there Jesus dwells in their
   midst, to draw them unto Him. And he said, "If I be lifted up, I will draw all my sheep unto
   me." All a man is required to do is to preach the same word that was restored to you and God is
   obligated to vindicate that. Is, that right?
   We notice, that, in John 12:6, there is a story you don't have to turn to it. of Martha and
   Mary and Lazarus. Martha and Mary made a supper for Jesus, the word of God. And it came
   during the course of the supper the Mary Magdalene, that loved Jesus so much because she had
   so much forgiven her, she loved much, and she did a good thing. She run and took the expensive
   ointment and fell down at Jesus' feet and began to wash his feet with that ointment.
   Then, there was one shepherd in there, a minister, stood up and looked in
   indignation. Peter and all of them was looking at him so strange, but he was one of the
   shepherds, too. And he said, "Why wasn't this expensive ointment taken and sold, and the money
   given to the poor?"
   And my! How the other shepherds must have felt bad to think that he’d say a thing like
   that. That he would come out and challenge the Great Shepherd on letting this woman do
   that. He thought he had the leading of the Spirit probably. Said, "Well..."
   The Bible said that Judas didn't say this because he loved the poor but, because he was a
   thief and loved the money bag that he was carrying.
   So, it is today, my friend, because of the hireling shepherds and the hireling ministers that
   has failed to preach the word of God to bring a Pentecost. They love the money bag more than
   they love to see the sheep of God get into Church order and receive the Baptism of the Holy
   Ghost. THEY LOVE THE MONEY-BAG.
   Judas showed himself that he was a money lover. Before Pentecost came, he showed his
   colors. Did he not? All right.
   
   34
   No wonder Jesus said all kinds of shepherds, that’s ever been coming before me in this
   day, is like thieves and the robbers. They start a little work, some of them make their selfshepherds. They start a little work and then as they go they say "Oh, I got it made, now. Got the
   tithes and offerings coming in," forget all about the love that they ought to have for God's sheep.
   Because God loves His sheep. Is, that right?
   So, God has been waiting till the restoration of the Bride tree came, until he restored a
   ministry that would be filled with the Holy Ghost, that would feed his sheep. That’s why you
   haven’t seen the great Outpouring of the Pentecost like they had in Acts 2. That is the reason,
   because God doesn’t feed sheep...
   Now, just think, this thing does happen. There is individuals that receive the Baptism of
   the Holy Ghost at home, other places but, that is very coincidental. But the five-fold ministry that
   God has predestinated has already seen a Burning Bush experience.
   God said, that before any man could minister to God's sheep, he had to have a burning
   bush experience. Because that burning bush experience would be the only thing that would hold
   him true to the true interpretation of God's word. Because it must, it must come by divine
   revelation to the shepherd. And then, when it comes, it is just in accord with what the messenger
   is bringing, because it comes from the same light. Is, that right?

   72 And what we need today, in our seminaries, it’s not so much theology to be taught, but a
   burning bush experience, where men get down before God and meet Him face to face. We
   need a challenger today like we had in that day. What we need is man and women who has
   met God, and know what they’re talking about. Not somebody trying to teach from some
   church book, or some open theology. What we need today, is a man that’s been in the presence
   of a burning bush, has been born again, and changed and made a new creature. That’s the
   type of person we need today. That’s the kind of person that will stay on the firing line,
   regardless of what comes or goes.
   Because of this, there has not been able, for the Great Shepherd to gather his sheep
   together into different folds to feed them. First, he feeds them. The Shepherd, the first thing He
   does is feed His sheep. Then He leads the whole flock down to the creek to water them. After
   they get their bellies full... And before you receive the Baptism of the Holy Ghost, God pregnates
   you with the word of God. Then the seed begins to grow. You get in that divine call of God,
   where they’re purposed for.
   Then, while the Word seed is in there, it just keeps a coming, keeps a coming, keeps a
   coming, He keeps pouring that green grass to you. You get fatter and fatter and fatter and fatter
   and fatter and you just get fatter, fatter. And then, after the Shepherd sees your faith arising
   because of the fullness of your tummy, Is, that right? Then, all at once there comes a sound from
   heaven, like a rushing mighty wind and it causes a river to come right down in your assembly
   and water every one of you. Then, while the preacher yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost
   watered every one of the sheep, sealed them every one into the kingdom of God. Yes, He did!
   
   35
   Now, we find here that, gathered around this supper, was twelve shepherds and one Great
   Shepherd. Is, that right? But, in the midst of there was a shepherd, just loved himself, loved the
   money bag. Jesus had to expose that man that didn't love God's sheep before Pentecost because,
   after the word had been fed to the sheep for three- and one-half years... How long have you been
   feeding this assembly, brother Coleman? (Brother Coleman says, "Three years.”) Amen?
   He had to prove to those shepherds that they couldn't love a money bag, they had to love
   God's sheep. Because then and then alone will the sheep have confidence in the ministers. When
   they see that the shepherds just doesn't want to gather them into a fold to take shears and shear
   the wool off and sell it and buy themselves a new car, build themselves a great building.
   Thief and a robber! God’s not going to give you his sheep. But he said of that faithful
   shepherd, "He that is a faithful shepherd, like me, that laid down his life for the sheep, I will
   open the door and let the sheep out. I’ll lead them out and bring them to that assembly that they
   may be full."
   Oh, how you ought to praise God, this morning. You know what I’m talking about. You
   know what I’m talking about, in this Local Christian Assembly. Fear not, shall the unbelief of
   the others make void your faith? None of you’ll never do it. God predestinated powerful
   apostolic assemblies around the world. That and that alone will fully vindicate Malachi 4.
   Because he said, that he come to restore a faith in the people that would make each one
   contend for the faith that was once delivered to the saints. They had faith when Paul said,
   "Submit yourself to church order. Submit yourself to those that have the rule over you." And
   said, "Return unto me and I will return unto you," saith the Lord.
   When the Word of God is preached and obeyed by the sheep, "There," Jesus said, "I am
   in your midst. Fear not little flock it’s your Father's good pleasure to give unto you everything
   that he owns, for by the Baptism of the Holy Ghost, you’re made heirs with Jesus Christ."
   Then you can say that you believe the message, all that you want to. I don't care what
   man preaches that, I’m not preaching "man," I’m preaching the Holy Ghost by inspiration, my
   own revelation, my own inspiration, by faith.
   You can believe all you want to. Judas believed all he could that he was one of the
   shepherds. Down in him he loved the money bag. I tell you; God's true shepherds got a bag all
   right, it is hanging on their side and it’s got five stones in it.
   When the other brothers, when the big Goliath rose up, the World Council of Churches,
   started coming on God's first flock, he went up there to see his brothers. He couldn't fellowship
   with them because he had a revelation from God that God called him to tend the sheep.
   It already proved; God proved Himself to him that he was a True Shepherd. Because,
   when the spirit come in and got on his sheep, he remembered what Paul said, said, "Timothy, “let
   no man despise your youth.” You may be a young minister," said, "rebuke them spirits off them
   sheep. Reprove them, exhort them, be long suffering."
   1 Timothy 4:10-16-Reference quote
   10 For therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is
   the Saviour of all men, specially of those that believe.

   David walked up there with a bag on his side, might have looked like Judas's bag but,
   there is a lot of difference in it. Judas had money in his and he had stones in his, five of them, fa-i-t-h, f-a-i-t-h of the word of God. Said, "What is the matter, Brethren? Looks like you’re
   bogged down here on this hill this morning?" Said, "What is the matter with the other ministers?"
   "Oh, Brother, why man, we ain't qualified like that man. Why, man, our ministers just
   follow the message around. That’s all it is, just follow the message around." He said, "You mean
   to tell me you’re gonna let that great big demon over there make fun of you?" Why, something
   stirred up in him, he said, "Why, I know God called me. Bless God, I know that God will give
   that devil into my hand." He began to contend for that faith.
   And they said, "Oh, why don't you go on back there to that little assembly you got, and
   mind your own business? We got the revelation here, Brother. We heard the tapes; we got the
   revelation. We know there ain't gonna be no apostolic church."
   How many have I heard tell me that? I say, "Well, Brother, it’s hard for me to believe
   that, you see, cause I’ve been studying the word and I can't find that in there. Now, if you can
   show me that in the word..." And when I begin to quote the word to them, well then by and by,
   it’s not in the Bible?
   But we find that he went and took the stones and took the sling shot and put faith in it and
   killed that devil. Is, that right?
   Well, God manifested who was his shepherds. He manifested who was a preacher and
   who wasn't. You’ll see the fruit of their preaching. You’ll see that the sheep began to have faith
   in God. They began to step out on the promises of God. They believe, they’ll begin to believe
   that every promise in the book is theirs. Cause after all, if God has us hedged in, who can be
   against us? Is, that right? And if God is greater than the house then he’s able to put the roof on it.
   God exposed old Judas, that money bag lover, before Pentecost. Why? I ask
   you? Why? There was the sheep, they was pregnated with the word message, they was sanctified
   by the word that was being preached but they hadn't had an experience with the one that had an
   experience with them, yet. They were just believing unto that experience. Is, that right? But then
   God had to make sure that before the Holy Ghost fell...
   Are you getting the picture? He had to have true shepherds to keep them lined up for that
   Promise. Keep them charged up, contending that God loved them and it was God's business to
   baptize them. All they had to do was to sit still and wait on the wind to come.
   Boy, I feel it in here now. I believe she’s going to come, Friend. All it takes is your faith
   to believe what I’m preaching this morning and you’ll get it.
   Now, God exposes the untrue shepherds. Why? Because new lambs, "new lambs," I said,
   was going to be born on the Day of Pentecost. God was going to give birth to three thousand
   pregnated lambs. Is, that right? Three thousand of them, so... Imagine, three thousand! He had to
   have shepherds somewhere. Is, that right? He’s bound to have shepherds if he’s got lambs.
   
   37
   Whoever heard of just having a multitude of sheep and no shepherds? Why, the sheep
   will just wander here in ditches and you can see how they’re wandering. They wander in this
   ditch and get their leg broke; they wander down that ditch and get their leg broke. They wander
   over here and get caught in a bush and begin to, "Maa, maa," and then God has to send them
   somewhere. Is, that right? All right.
   Now, we find that three thousand lambs was going to be born on the Day of Pentecost, so
   He had to expose before Pentecost. Is, that right? That sheep don't follow a money bag lover,
   they only follow a man that’s preaching the word of God to them and contending for the same
   thing. Is, that right?
   Now, we find that Peter knew something about this money bag that Judas had. He was
   there, he ought to known. No wonder he said over in his epistle, said to the ministers, "Feed the
   flock of God, which is among you. Taking the oversight... Don't let them be trying to see and
   figure it out but you take the oversight over them. Cause I have given you the eyes to see
   spiritually and haven't them." Is, that right?
   1 Peter 5:2-5-Reference quote:
   2 Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but
   willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;
   3 Neither as being lords over God's heritage, but being ensamples to the flock.
   4 And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not
   away.
   5 Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all of you be subject one to
   another, and be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the
   humble.
   Can you imagine, sheep now, telling the shepherd, like they’re doing today tell a Godpredestinated shepherd, now, that has got a gift of preaching inside of him, trying to tell him the
   interpretation of the tapes? Say, "Why, we’re supposed to go up here and feed on this
   pasture. Oh, I... No, shepherd, I think it would be better if we would go down here and get water
   first."

   304 By lack of this revelation is why we have so many different divisions among us, and so
   much mockery. So much division among us, is because the people lack that revelation. See,
   they lack that revelation, the teachers.
   No, you get fed first and then you go to water. Even the law of nature will tell you, don't
   drink your water until after you eat your food. Archie tried to tell me this, this week. Is, that

   62-1123 - The Way Back
   William Marrion Branham
   It takes death to produce life. You’ve got to die to your own thinking. You’ve got to die to your
   own theology. You’ve got to die to your own self, to your own human ways. You’ve got to be
   regenerated, a new creature, a new creation. Before you can be that… You can’t be two at the
   same time; you got to die to one in order to be born in the other. It brings a mess, and it causes a
   mess too. But you’re—you got new life. What difference does it make? You got to do it.
   So, the sheep, they just wander and broken legs, stumble in this ditch... But if they’d only
   prayed, "God, lead me to a shepherd. Lead me to an assembly, Lord. God give us a
   shepherd." Then, if you are a true sheep, God is obligated to give you a true shepherd. That’s just
   plain as can be. That’s just plain as can be.
   Imagine the sheep, now, when they get up that morning to go eat, the manna came down
   from heaven early in the morning. Is, that right? But as soon as they’d rise up in the morning, the
   old devil jumps on them and they say, "I think we ought go over here and eat today. I think we
   ought to go over here and eat today." Is, that right? But God predestinated, divinely called
   shepherds to lead his sheep into those spiritual pastures.
   Now, He didn't call a hireling shepherd, a thief and a robber, that wouldn't come by the
   door. Now, notice that Jesus said He was the door. And, it said, "No man, no shepherd can enter
   in and get those sheep unless they come by the door."
   Friend, if you got... Minister friend, if you ever hear this tape, if you got any other
   purpose in your mind than loving God's sheep, than being in God's will, you’re fooling
   yourself. God ain’t gonna lead you to his sheep. You’ve got to love his sheep.
   Peter said, "Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not
   by constraint, but willingly out of love, not for filthy lucre," he said, a thief and a robber, "not for
   filthy lucre, like Judas," he was saying. "But of a ready mind." Ready to avenge everything that
   comes upon God's sheep. "Rebuke, exhort, chastise with the word of God, Timothy." Is, that
   right? "That you might present that sheep blameless in the day in the coming of the Lord." That’s
   it. Do you get the picture of a true shepherd?
   Ephesians 5:26-27-Reference quote:
   26 That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word,
   27 That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such
   thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.
   Peter said, "Neither as being lords over God's heritage, but being examples to the
   flock." Being examples to the flock. "And when the true Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive
   a crown of glory that fadeth not away," reserved in the heavens for you, Shepherd. My, what an
   encouragement to a man to stand upon the word of God today.

   Peter ought to know, he was there when Judas got upset about the expensive ointment
   that came down on Jesus' feet. No wonder Peter was able to say this, here in Peter [II Peter 5:2-
   3], "Feed my flock, take the oversight not by constraint, not for filthy lucre’s sake, but out of
   love."
   1 Peter 5:2-Reference quote:
   2 Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by
   constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;
   
   Because we find that after this supper, that I’m speaking of here where Judas exposed
   himself, Peter told the other apostles, they didn't believe that Jesus...They was downhearted. And
   they didn't really believe that they could do the things that Christ told them that they could do.
   Peter really didn't believe that He said, "Whatsoever ye ask in my Name, I will do it,"
   and, "If you speak unto this mountain be thou removed and cast into the sea and not doubt in
   your heart what you said will come to pass." Peter didn't really believe those things. He didn't
   really believe that he could say unto this fig tree, curse that fig tree and make it die. He just knew
   that he didn't have it in him and he seen that Jesus was dead now, and so what is the use.
   Though he was disgusted and the ole devil was beating ole Peter down and he told the
   other apostles, said, "Brethren, I go a fishing." What Peter really said was, said, "Brethren, I tell
   you what I’m going to do, you’ll can sit around and moan, cry if you want to, but I’m goin back
   to my fishing business. I’m going back to my fishing business. It’s too confusing to me. I don't
   understand all this. I thought Jesus was supposed to come and set up the great millennium and be
   King over the whole world again and kill all these Romans." Said, "Oh, I don't understand it. So,
   I’m just going back to my fishing business."
   Oh, I tell you it sure is like me. Peter went back to his fishing business and the others
   said, "Peter we’re goin back in business with yea, cause they was in business with him before—
   James and John. So, Peter went down and the other apostles and went back into the fishing
   business and fished all night and netted all night and didn't catch a thing.
   That’s just like God. His predestinated purpose will find its way. All things work together
   for good to them that are predestinated according to God's purpose. Is, that right? Oh, you maybe
   come through all kinds of trials and say, "God, it is so confusing to me, this message. I’m just
   gonna give up." You can't give up, because where else would you go? You got to come on
   because God predestinated you.
   One of us know better than the other. I’ve broke both legs, I have crushed my arms, my
   head’s been caved in, my heart has been bleeding, but I’m predestinated. I started back in my
   fishing business several times, say, "God take the calling away from me, it’s too... I don't
   understand this thing. Lord, it is too hard, God." Then after I do that, I'd say, "O God, I am sorry
   I said that, Lord, forgive me," begin to repent. Ain't you done it?
   Oh, we have had broken legs and broken arms and we have been bruised and beaten but,
   we still love one another. We’re still pressing on. Little bit differences from us but God’s going
   
   40
   to heal that sore. And I tell you what it would take, it would take a real good Baptism of the Holy
   Ghost to heal it. God is going to give it, he promised it and it’s gonna come... GOD’S GONNA
   SUPPLY IT! GOD’S GOING TO GIVE us what our hearts desire is. Is, that right?
   So, he said... Standing on the bank there and the apostles was out there in the fishing
   business again. Notice, Jesus wasn't worried. The whole foundation of the Church rested upon
   those twelve men out in that boat. The whole foundation of the Church rested upon twelve
   men. And the Apostolic Assembly is resting upon you and I today, our shoulders.
   The Bible said, "Take one word away or add one word to it," if you say there is not a
   five-fold ministry then you’re wrong, then you took your word out of the Book. Is, that right? If
   you would add one word to it, that wouldn't be right, you put yourself under judgment. Is, that
   right? But, God is not worried about that. The foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal,
   God knoweth His sheep. Is, that right? Here is the seal of God sure.
   Revelation 22:19-Reference quote:
   9 And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take
   away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are
   written in this book.
   So, what we find? The whole church of Pentecost, that’s going to be born at Pentecost...
   Now, they’ve been pregnated by the word but no Baptism, yet. Is, that right? Don't you believe
   nobody when they tell you that, "Believe the Message and you have got the Holy Ghost."

   59-1217 - What Was The Holy Ghost Given For?
   William Marrion Branham
   And when Paul came up and heard him preach, knowed he was a great man, he said, “Have you
   received the Holy Ghost since you have believed?” They said, “We know not there…whether
   there be any Holy Ghost.” He said, “Then to what,” or the real Greek word there is, “to how
   was you baptized?” They said, “We have been baptized already by John the Baptist.” 62 Now
   watch what Paul said. Paul said, that, “John verily baptized unto repentance; not for remission
   of sins, but unto repentance, saying, that’s what you believed.” WHEN YOU ACCEPT CHRIST
   AS YOUR PERSONAL SAVIOUR, YOU ARE BELIEVING UNTO THE BAPTISM OF THE
   HOLY GHOST. THAT IS NOT THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST, MY DEAR
   BAPTIST BRETHREN. IT IS WRONG. A brother said to me the other day, said, “Brother
   Branham,” or some time ago, months ago, he said, “Brother Branham, Abraham believed God,
   
   41
   and it was imputed unto him for righteousness.” I said, “Truly.” Said, “What more can a man
   do than believe?” 63 I said, “That’s all a man can do. That’s all he can do today, is believe God.
   But God gave him a seal of circumcision,” that we went through last night, “as a sign that He
   had accepted his faith in Him.” AND, TODAY, UNTIL GOD… YOU BELIEVE UNTO HIM
   WHEN YOU ACCEPT HIM AS YOUR PERSONAL SAVIOUR. BUT WHEN GOD GIVES
   YOU THE SEAL OF THE HOLY GHOST, HE SEALED YOU TO YOUR ETERNAL
   DESTINATION. Now you Baptists take that, and I’ll go with you on Eternal security. Yes, sir.
   Because, “Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby you are sealed until the day of your
   redemption.” You are not sealed by believing unto, but sealed by the Holy Ghost. Ephesians
   4:30, “Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby you are sealed until the day of your
   redemption.” That seals you, when you’ve found favor with God, and He sealed you by the
   Holy Spirit. That’s so, for the Bible said, “No man can call Jesus the Christ, only by the Holy
   Ghost.” 64 You say, “I believe it because the pastor said so.” He’s right, but that doesn’t count
   for you. “I believe it because the Word says so.” That’s right, but that isn’t for you, that doesn’t
   count you. The only way that you can say that Jesus is the Christ, is when the Holy Ghost
   comes into you and bears record, and witness Itself out, “He is the Son of God.” That’s the
   only way you know the resurrection, is when the Holy Ghost bears record. “When He the Holy
   Ghost is come, He will testify of Me, show you things to come; bring these things, that I said,
   to your memories.” You’ll never find it in the school. See? He will bring these things to your
   memories. 65 Now we want to read just a little further in this Scripture now, Saint John 14:12.
   Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and
   greater… Which, the right translation there is “more,” if you want to look it up. …greater
   works than these shall he do; because I go to the Father. 66 If He went to the Father, the Holy
   Spirit would come. Is that right? Another Scripture said, “If I go not away, the Comforter will
   not come. But if I go away, I’ll come again and be with you, even in you.” See, it’s God with you.
   Over you, first; with you, in Christ; in you, in the Holy Ghost. It’s God in you. 67 Now, “The
   works that I do shall you do also,” not another work. But God wants to bring the Holy Ghost,
   in you, to continue the same work that He was doing in Christ.
   Could you tell a Sister here in this assembly, that is pregnant and ready to have a baby,
   and go over to the hospital and see that baby born and tell her she didn't have the experience of
   having a baby?
   Why, you say... I say, "When did you receive the Holy Ghost?" "Well, I don't know, I
   just believe the message and got it." Huh, Friend, the devil has deceived you. If you don't know
   when you got a new birth, you ain't had one yet. You haven't had one yet! You’re just
   believing unto that new birth.

   “Blessed art thou, for flesh and blood never revealed This to you. You never learned It from
   some school. But My Father which is in Heaven has revealed It to you.” Notice what He said to
   him, “Upon this rock…” That’s Peter, the predestinated Seed of God that had received this
   Light, and given the keys to the Kingdom. “Upon this rock of revelation of Who Jesus Christ
   is,” He is the full, manifested God. “Upon this rock…” Not a Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; and
   Him being the second Person. “Upon this rock I’ll build My Church, and the gates of hell will
   never shake It down, never prevail against It.” See? “I’ll build My Church upon this rock,” a
   revelation of Jesus Christ. 233 Look, Christ in you makes Him the center of Life of the
   revelation. See? Christ’s Life in you makes Him the center of the revelation. Christ, in the
   Bible, makes the Bible the complete revelation of Christ. Christ in you makes you the complete
   revelation of the whole thing, see, what God is trying to do. 234 WHAT IS THE NEW BIRTH
   THEN? YOU’D SAY, “WELL, BROTHER BRANHAM, WHAT IS THE NEW BIRTH?” IT
   IS THE REVELATION OF JESUS CHRIST PERSONALLY TO YOU. AMEN! See? Not you
   joined a church, you shook a hand, you done something different, you said a creed, you promised
   to live by a—a code of rules. But Christ, the Bible, He is the Word that was revealed to you.
   And no matter what anybody says, what takes place, it’s Christ; pastor, priest, whatever it

   62-0909M - Countdown
   William Marrion Branham
   36 There’s so many things that we could speak of here. I got a list wrote down that take me two
   hours to get through it, nearly, and Scriptures to back this up, like if you want some of them here
   to back it up. Like First John 5:7, shows the natural and the spiritual birth, and so forth, “water,
   Blood, and Spirit.” And three in Heaven, “Father, Son, and Holy Spirit,” these three are one.
   There are three that agree in earth, they’re not one, but they agree in one, in the earth, that’s
   “water, Blood, and Spirit.” See, “water, Blood, and Spirit,” like the natural birth type it. 37 So if
   a man sets on the thought of “just justification is all you have to have,” he’s wrong, wrong. He’s
   got to be wrong. And then if the church who believes like the many of the Pentecostals, that the
   Holy Ghost is it, “that’s all, just repent and get the Holy Ghost,” that’s still wrong, because
   you’ve got to get sanctification in there to cleanse it before the Holy Ghost comes in. If you
   don’t, you leave out the Blood. See? And the new Birth, as people talks that the baptism of the
   Holy Ghost is the new Birth. Now, that’s wrong. THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST IS
   DIFFERENT FROM THE NEW BIRTH. THE NEW BIRTH IS WHEN YOU’RE BORN
   AGAIN. BUT THE HOLY GHOST IS WHEN POWER COMES INTO THAT BIRTH FOR
   SERVICE. That’s exact. See? The Holy Ghost is…baptized into the Holy Ghost. 38 The new
   Birth, you have THE NEW BIRTH by being believing on the Lord Jesus Christ. See? BY
   HAVING FAITH and accepting Him as your Saviour, that’s Birth, see, because you’ve passed
   
   43
   from death unto Life. Now, if you want to back that up, take Saint John 5:24, “He that heareth
   My Words and believeth on Him that sent Me, has everlasting Life.” See, he’s got Life because
   he believes. And that same group had to go to Pentecost to be baptized with the Holy Ghost.
   Exact. 39 HOLY GHOST IS POWER FOR SERVICE. So when talk about you got to be born
   again, and applying that to the Holy Ghost, many of the Methodists and so forth are wrong there.
   It cannot. It just won’t cope through the Scripture here. You get the thing sideways. It’s got to
   take it the way the Scripture’s got it placed out here. See? And the Holy Spirit is a… “You shall
   receive the new Birth after this”? What? No. “YOU SHALL RECEIVE POWER,” ACTS 1:8,
   “AFTER THIS THE HOLY GHOST IS COME UPON YOU.” SEE? AND THEY HAD
   ALREADY BELIEVED TO ETERNAL LIFE, AND SO FORTH, BUT THEY HAD TO
   HAVE THE HOLY GHOST FOR POWER. “YOU SHALL BE WITNESSES UNTO ME
   AFTER THE HOLY GHOST IS COME UPON YOU,” BECAUSE THE HOLY GHOST IS A
   WITNESS OF THE RESURRECTION, SHOWING THAT YOU HAVE BECOME AN
   ADULT IN CHRIST. 40 Now, the natural. All things spiritual, all happenings and so forth tap,
   or type the supernatural, or the—the natural is a type of the supernatural.
   FIRST THERE CAME WATER, THE WORD; THEN, THERE CAME BLOOD,
   SANCTIFICATION; BUT WHEN HE SAID, "IT IS FINISHED," THAT GAVE YOU POWER
   FOR SERVICE. YOU BELIEVE THE WORD WILL JUSTIFY YOU, YOU KEEP ON
   BELIEVING, AND IT’LL SANCTIFY YEA, YOU KEEP ON BELIEVING UNTO ACTS 2:38
   AND THEN GOD WILL BAPTIZE YOU INTO THE BODY BECAUSE YOU BELIEVE THE
   MESSAGE. AND THEN HE’LL GIVE YOU POWER AND SET YOU INTO SERVICE.

   Then, through that they’re washed by the waters of the Word. Hearing the Word they receive
   intellectual faith: intellectual faith. Now, that’s just about as far as half the church gets, or
   more, intellectual faith. Say, “Oh, yeah, I believe that.” But wait. There’s more to it yet before
   redemption is completed. Have to go through something else. 40 Remember, you’re in the
   courts now. But the next thing is to enter into the fellowship with the believers on the common
   ground of fellowship. And before they could enter through after the waters of separation had
   separated them from their sin, then they had to go through the public testimony of seven stripes
   of blood, showing that death went before them to pay the way. And, every believer, after
   hearing the Word, has to come to the recognition of the Lord Jesus Christ, death going before
   them to bring them into the fellowship. Then inside, coming through the sprinkled blood at the
   door. Remember, it was seven stripes. The seven stripes spoke of the seven ages, seven church
   ages, that also… Seven is God’s perfect number. NO OTHER WAY OF REDEMPTION ONLY
   THROUGH THE BLOOD through the seven years, six thousand years even to the Millennium.
   NOTHING BUT THE BLOOD WILL BE RECOGNIZED ANY TIME. A PUBLIC
   TESTIMONY TO THE BLOOD COMES LIFE. AND THEY HAD TO ENTER THROUGH
   EVERY AGE THROUGH THE BLOOD. AND AFTER ENTERING THE BLOOD, THEY
   COME INTO FELLOWSHIP. What a beautiful thing here. 41 The only ground… Here it is,
   get it. Oh, I—I feel religious; I really do. Look, the only grounds that any believer can meet God
   
   44
   on, is in the Blood: only ground, no other ground, only… In the Old Testament there was not
   another place anywhere that God would receive… They had to come to the tabernacle, and THE
   TABERNACLE REPRESENTED CHRIST. FOR IN THE TEMPLE THE LAMB WAS
   SLAYED, AND THE BLOOD WAS SHED. Only on the basis of shed Blood will God meet the
   believer. Amen. All your dry, cut theology will never please God till you come into the Blood of
   Jesus Christ. Amen. Pretty strong, but it’ll do you good. ONLY IN THE BLOOD IS THE
   FELLOWSHIP. 42 Now, in the Blood of the Lord Jesus… God came down out of glory, brought
   Hisself into the womb of a woman. And there, God, the Creator, wrapped around Himself and
   created a Blood cell, the virgin not knowing any man. If you don’t believe that, you’re still in
   sin. She had nothing to do with a man. God, Himself… Christ was not a Jew. His Blood wasn’t
   a Jew, neither was it a Gentile. It was God’s Blood. The Blood cell come from the Male, and
   the Male was God. The Bible said we’re saved through the Blood of God, no sex into it at all.
   There it is.
   Now, I ask you a question, how could he set you in the service when you’re not in Bible
   order? Come on now, let's get with it this morning. How could you be baptized with the Holy
   Ghost and you’re not in service, you’re not even an assembly, so you couldn't be in service, if
   you’re not a minister. Now, that is true.
   First, pregnated, justified; then go on believing that you’re pregnated with the word, then
   you get sanctified. Because, Timothy will rebuke you, he’ll exhort you until you clean your life
   up and believe God. Is, that right? Say, "Amen!" Then you’re believing unto the Baptism of the
   Holy Ghost.
   It’s the Baptism of the Holy Ghost, an experience... God said, I know my sheep by
   experience and they know me by experience. And then by that experience they follow me. Is that
   right? They that are born of the Spirit of God are led by the Spirit of God to that assembly. Is that
   right?
   Now, going up to Pentecost, they had the word in them, they were sanctified. Is, that
   right? But then, all at once, their faith let down, they went fishing. They went fishing! And Jesus
   appeared to them, as I said, the whole Church was resting upon that. And He called out to the
   boat, said, "Children, have you caught any meat?"
   Well, they didn't get upset because in those days there was a man that stood upon the
   bank, a high bank, and looked down on the water and he guided them toward the school of
   fish. Well, they thought that he saw a school of fish See? So they didn't get upset. They said,
   "No, sir!" Said, "We went back into fishing business just last night. We fished all night. I can't
   understand it, we ain't even caught a one."
   Oh, He said, "Cast your net on this side." Now Peter said, "What’s with that guy up
   there? Man, we fished this spot all night. I don't see no school of fish down there."
   God knows where the fish are at. If you’re led by the Spirit, he’ll let you go and cast the
   net right where they’re at. I’ve experienced that. Why, all at once, I’d be fishing only wouldn't
   catch anything and I would hit a spot and, brother, there would be all kinds of them right
   there. Boy, I just fish and fish and fish. Oh, that’s a wonderful thing if you love fishing.
   And Peter said, "W-W-What, what, what? I don't see no school of fish. What’s the matter
   with that man? He must be looking at that water so long, the sun came out, he’s got blind or
   something." And he said, “Go ahead, cast your net on the other side.” So, all right boys, go ahead
   
   45
   and let her down one more..." You don't know how much work it is to let those nets out and
   bring them in. That’s a lot of work, Boy.
   So, they let it down and, Brother, when they started to pull that in, the fish began to jump
   and jump out of the net and they... The net began to break and... Oh, boy, then they knew
   something, something has happened. It was probably some kind of a feeling come down over
   them, you know, like you feel. And they said, "Oh, wait a minute, boys, there is something
   wrong here."
   Peter, boy, he begin to look at Him, boy, and all at once he jumped into that water, put his
   raincoat on and jumped in the water and took off. And they said, "Boys, look at Peter. Oh, it is...
   Oh... That’s the Lord, that’s who it is!" Boy, and they all took up for shore as hard as they could
   go, lickity-split.
   And ole Peter, boy, I can see him a swimming, now. Boy, he swum up there and come
   out and Jesus stood there and calmly said, "Come and dine, come and dine." Said, "I know where
   the fish is at, don't get discouraged. I know where the fish is at and I got the bread to feed them
   with. I’ve got it all."
   God’s got justification for you; God’s got sanctification for you and GOD’S GOT THE
   HOLY GHOST FOR YOU BECAUSE HE LOVES YOU. It’s God that worketh his will
   according to His purpose. WHY WORRY ABOUT IT, YOU’LL GET IT. HE HAS PROMISED
   IT. Said, "Come and dine. I’ve got the bread and I’ve got the fish upon the fire."
   Ephesians 1:11-Reference quote:
   11 In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the
   purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will:
   Boy, and they was hungry. And as they began to eat that, how good that fish must have
   tasted, that Jesus fed them. It was cooked by the Fire of the Holy Ghost. It had to have been
   good, Friend. Boy, how would you like to eat some fish, this morning, fed to you by the Fire of
   the Holy Ghost?
   And then He said to Peter, while Peter was just getting through eating and wiping his
   mouth, feeling guilty because he went back in his fishing business. And He said, "Peter, lovest
   thou Me?"
   Boy, and he got...?... "Lord, you know I love You!" Then He said, "Peter, lovest thou
   Me?" Says, "Lord, what you asking that for, I am hurting anyway?" "Lovest thou Me
   Peter?" "Lord, you know I love You!" Then He asked him the third time. Every time that Jesus
   spoke, He said, "Lovest thou Me?"
   John 21:12-17-Reference quote:
   12 Jesus saith unto them, Come and dine. And none of the disciples durst ask him, Who art
   thou? knowing that it was the Lord.
   13 Jesus then cometh, and taketh bread, and giveth them, and fish likewise.
   14 This is now the third time that Jesus shewed himself to his disciples, after that he was risen
   from the dead.
   
   46
   15 So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me
   more than these? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him,
   Feed my lambs.
   16 He saith to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? He saith unto
   him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my sheep.
   17 He saith unto him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved
   because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou
   knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep.
   That word "love," in the Greek, is an Agapao, God's love. And Peter answered,
   "Truly." He said, "Truly, Lord, I love You." But Peter did love Him. But he could only love Him
   with as much love that he had. And that was only justification, enough love to believe His
   Word. He only loved Him through sanctification, enough to sanctify him.
   BUT, WHEN GOD SAID, "DO YOU LOVE ME?" He’ll require a great Agapao Love
   that only God can give you by the Baptism of the Holy Ghost. And if every time that God spoke,
   he used that Agapao love and every time that Peter spoke, he used only a phileo love.
   YOU CAN'T LOVE GOD; YOU CAN'T CALL HIM YOUR LORD AND MASTER
   WITHOUT GOD'S LOVE IN YOU TO BAPTIZE YOU WITH THE HOLY GHOST. IT’S
   GOD'S LOVE. And He asked him the third time, said, "Peter, lovest thou Me?" And the Bible
   said that Peter got hurt and confused and he said, "Lord! You know I love You." But it still, all
   of his desperation he could only muster that justification, sanctification love.
   AND “EXCEPT A MAN TAKE UP HIS CROSS AND FOLLOW AFTER THE GREAT
   SHEPHERD HE’S NOT WORTHY OF ME.” Your righteousness of justification, your
   righteousness of sanctification IS NOT ENOUGH. GOD REQUIRES A BAPTISM OF
   LOVE. Then and then alone, can you say that he is your Lord. "NO MAN CAN CALL JESUS
   HIS LORD EXCEPT BY THE HOLY GHOST," GOD'S LOVE!
   1 Corinthians 12:3-Reference quote:
   3 Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus
   accursed: and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.
   
   Jesus said unto Peter the third time, "Lovest thou Me?" to Peter. Out of desperation and
   hurt, tears running down his beard, "Lord, I know I went back into the fishing business. Lord, I
   know I lack faith, God. I lack faith in doing these things." He said, "Peter, feed My sheep. Don't
   be a thief and a robber. Peter, lovest thou Me? Feed My sheep, Peter."
   John 21:17-Reference quote:
   17 He saith unto him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved
   because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou
   knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep.

   Peter didn't understand it. Peter and them faithfully went on down to the Upper Room.

   days hence.
   Peter still hurt by that experience but he forgot that God had given him the keys to the
   Kingdom of God.
   Matthew 16:15-19-Reference quote:
   5 He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am?
   16 And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.
   17 And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Bar–jona: for flesh and
   blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.
   18 And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church;
   and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.
   19 And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt
   bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be
   loosed in heaven.
   And when the great Holy Ghost came, it said there was a sound... Have you heard a
   sound? It said there was Fire. Have you had the Fire? He said, "And it filled them with the Holy
   Ghost and they begin to speak with other languages."
   Acts 2:1-8-Reference quote:
   1 And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place.
   2 And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all
   the house where they were sitting.
   3 And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them.
   4 And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the
   Spirit gave them utterance.
   5 And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven.
   6 Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded,
   because that every man heard them speak in his own language.
   7 And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying one to another, Behold, are not all these
   which speak Galilæans?
   8 And how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born?
   You can't receive a supernatural God that created the world by His Word. You can't
   receive a God like that unless something supernatural happens. And that supernatural God that
   comes in you, baptizes you down into His Body. Then and only then do you have God's
   love. Then, only then are you set into service.
   
   48
   Here Peter was only set aside for service but it wasn't enough. He believed the word, the
   message, but it wasn't enough. The only way this message can come alive in this last day and
   prove that a prophet of God has brought the restoration of the Bride tree, is to see that tree bring
   forth fruit. AND IT’LL NEVER BRING FORTH FRUIT UNLESS YOU RECEIVE GOD'S
   LOVE OF BAPTISM OF POWER.
   They were filled with the Holy Ghost, began to speak with other languages as the
   supernatural Spirit in them gave them utterance. That made them a tabernacle of God. That made
   them a house of God. Is, that right? That set them in the temple of Solomon. Said, "Solomon's
   temple would come together. The ankle bone to the knee bone." Is, that right? The stones came
   together without a sound of a hammer.
   1 Kings 6:7-Reference quote:
   7 And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready before it was brought

   Look. When Solomon built the temple, they was cut out from all over the world. But when they
   come together, there wasn’t a buzz of a saw nor the sound of a hammer. Every block, no
   matter, if this one might’ve been cut like Oneness, and this one Twoness, and this one
   Threeness, and this one Fiveness, or whatever it was. But when they come together, they went
   dovetail one with the other. That’s right. And there wasn’t any arguing; there wasn’t any
   buzzing; there wasn’t any fussing; they just went together and made the temple of God. That’s
   right. And I believe that God is cutting out everywhere borned again children of God, and
   going to bring them together. I may not live to see it, but I hope I do. 26 But someday, you’re
   going to have to… You remember, there’s young people setting here. Someday those
   denominational barriers, and ideas that fanatics has got out there, and scooped around, and
   separated the people, will be taken away; and God will bring His Church together and take It
   home. Just as certain as anything in the world. That’s… They’re going to come; that’s prophecy.
   Remember that. I spoke that in the Name of the Lord. Now, you can put that down upon the book.
   Now, that was true. I didn’t know I was saying, going to say that. Now, that’s right. That’s how
   God will bring His Church together. You can depend on that. And as long as you argue and fuss
   with one another, you’re in the kindergarten. God will just keep you there, till you learn enough
   to get out of it. That’s all. Amen. Well, praise the Lord. All right. That’s right. Get out. Have
   faith. Step out on the Word of God. Jesus said, “They…”

   76 Oh, the rejecting of the Stone! “The Stone was rejected.” Why? When they built the
   Solomon’s temple… 77 I want you to notice a very beautiful picture here. When they went to
   building Solomon’s temple, the stones was cut out, from one place, and another place, and
   
   49
   another place. Some of them was cut this a way, and some that way. But the Bible said, that,
   when they come together…It taken forty years, I believe, to erect the temple. And there wasn’t
   a buzz of a saw, nor the sound of a hammer, in forty years. The stones going together, stone on
   stone; only thing they had to do is smear a little mortar across it and set it down there. And it
   stuck, stone by stone, stone by stone. Think of that. 78 Now here is my idea of it, brethren. When
   the…That temple there represented the Temple, spiritual, the Temple that we are now in. They
   come into the temple for their blessing. We are baptized into the Temple of God, into the Body
   of God, into the Body of Jesus Christ. And we’re in Christ, by Holy Spirit baptism; First

   64-0705 - The Masterpiece
   William Marrion Branham
   35 Now, a genuine sculptor is inspired, like a genuine poet, or any genuine singer, musician,
   whatever it might be. All real has to come by inspiration. Michelangelo must have had the
   inspiration of what Moses really looked like. And he caught it in his mind, what Moses must have
   been. So he set forth on this great piece of marble, the cutting to the pattern, and bringing
   down, and honing down, until he got to the real picture of what it must have been in his mind.
   36 And then when he got it all so perfect, every corner off, and every place rubbed, and the eyes
   just right, every hair, and beard, all just the way it was, he stood off and looked at it. I—I think
   of—of many, many hard years of labor, and how he had to hold that same vision all the time, in
   his mind, of what he was going to do. And just think, that vision on his mind for so many years,
   to make it look just exactly to what it was! He caught the vision first, and how he had to work to
   that vision, cutting off and making down! And when he got it to where he perfected it, till it really
   got perfect; he stood and looked at it when he finished up that morning, with a hammer in his
   hand. AND HE WAS SO INSPIRED WHEN HE LOOKED AT IT, BECAUSE THE VISION
   OF HIS MIND WAS STANDING BEFORE HIM, IN REALITY. What he had seen, and
   the…his conception of what Moses was, there it was figured before him, what he had had in his
   heart all these years. And toils, and hours of sorrow and distress, and critics, and everything
   else, but yet he stayed right with the vision until it was completed. 37 And then when it was
   completed, he stood back with the hammer, or sculptor’s hammer, in his hand, and he looked at
   that monument. AND THE INSPIRATION OF THE VISION THAT HE HAD SEEN, OF
   HOW TO DO IT, INSPIRED HIM SO MUCH TILL HE…THE INSPIRATION STRUCK
   HIM TILL HE GOT BESIDE HISSELF, AND STRUCK IT ACROSS THE KNEE, AND
   SAID, “SPEAK!” 38 Now THERE’S A FLAW ON THAT GREAT IMAGE, on the knee, on
   the right knee. Just above the knee, about six inches, is a place (I’ve put my hand on it) about
   that deep. 39 After he had spent all that time, for years and years, to make this; then under the—
   the influence of seeing fulfilled what he had seen in his heart and in his vision, and desired to
   see, it was completed. And when it was completed, he was so inspired by it till he thought his
   own masterpiece should speak back to him. AND HE STRUCK IT ACROSS THE LEG, AND
   HOLLER, “SPEAK!” AND IT MADE A FLAW ON IT. IT PUT A FLAW ON THE IMAGE.
   40 TO ME, THE FLAW WAS WHAT MADE IT THE MASTERPIECE. Now, maybe to the—
   the mind that might think different, YOU THINK THAT SPOILED IT. NO, TO ME, IT—IT
   MADE IT WHAT IT WAS. IT—IT…BECAUSE OF AFTER SO MANY YEARS OF
   
   50
   CAREFUL WORK AND TOILS, AND INSPIRATION, AND SO FORTH, OF MAKING IT,
   HIS TOIL HAD PROVED NOT IN VAIN. IT WAS PERFECT, AND THAT’S WHY HE
   CRIED OUT, “SPEAK!” Because, he had seen before him that he (was) had been able to
   achieve, to bring to pass the vision that was in his mind. And therefore, under inspiration, he
   done something out of the reason, out of the ordinary. He struck it, and hollered, “Speak!” See,
   he wouldn’t have done that if he had thought. But he didn’t think. It was inspiration of seeing
   what he had in his mind setting there perfectly before him. 41 His toils, and wearies, and long
   nights, and housed away from the world for days, and maybe eat a sandwich. And—and rub on
   it, and get back, and, “No, that’s just not the way it was. Now it’s got to come down to this,” and
   rubbing it. Then when he saw it, just perfect, then he saw in reality. THE NEGATIVE OF THE
   WHAT WAS IN HIS MIND HAD BECOME REAL, IT BECOME POSITIVE, THEREFORE
   IT SPRUNG INTO HIM. AND IT WAS SO REAL THAT HE MUST CRY OUT, “SPEAK!”
   42 TO ME, IT WAS A REFLECTION. IT WAS—IT WAS A COMPLIMENT TO HIS WORK,
   THAT HIS OWN WORK SO INSPIRED HIM, THAT HE WOULD BECOME BESIDE
   HIMSELF TO SMITE IT AND TO SAY, “SPEAK!” 43 I stood there and looked at the
   monument. I thought of the hours that the man must have put, in making that. They said how
   many years it was. But it—it was a reflection to him, because it was a contribution to his—to his
   great art, his great work of what he was doing. And when he finally was able to achieve it, it
   was so great. 44 Now let us turn the page, of Michelangelo, and close the book. And let’s open
   another Book and read of the great Sculptor, the Almighty. Who, before there was a world,
   and before the foundations was laid, He had in His mind what He wanted, AND HE
   WANTED TO MAKE MAN IN HIS OWN IMAGE. He wanted to make something in—in
   reality of what was a vision to Him, what was in His thinking. 45 Now, to Michelangelo, that
   was AN ATTRIBUTE OF HIS THOUGHT. AND GOD WANTED TO MAKE A MAN
   AFTER HIS IMAGE, THE GREAT SCULPTOR, AND HE WENT TO WORK ON HIM.
   AND WE NOTICE AS HE BROUGHT UP FROM THE MATERIALS. The first perhaps was
   fishes, and then the birds, and—and then the creeping things upon the earth, and—and many
   things that He brought. But, finally, as He brood, of being Creator, He had…HE WASN’T
   LIKE A MAN, NOW, A SCULPTOR THAT HAS TO TAKE SOMETHING THAT’S BEEN
   CREATED, TO HEW AN IMAGE. HE WAS THE SCULPTOR OF ETERNAL THINGS. HE
   WAS THE SCULPTOR THAT COULD CREATE AND BRING INTO EXISTENCE THAT
   WHICH HE HAS IN HIS MIND TO DO. Or, otherwise, He can make material what His
   attributes desired.
   It come like a wind, like Nicodemus heard it, was supposed to hear it. "The wind
   bloweth where it listeth but thou hearest the sound thereof but canst not tell whence the Holy
   Ghost come and where it went." So is everyone that is born of the Spirit of God. You can't even
   see the Kingdom of God unless you have had that experience. Is, that right?

   5 Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the

   God is putting His Bride together, now. He has got Church order established. He’s got
   faithful pastors here in this assembly to feed you. They’ve proven themselves. And I might say
   this, forgive me Brethren, not a penny did they take from you. Not a penny did they take. They
   rebuked the spirits from you. But you came back because God led you here. They proved
   themselves to you, that they wasn't after the money. Remember my message now, back
   there. They have proved it.
   Before Pentecost fell... They proved this before the Baptism of the Holy Ghost
   came. Now, when God is getting ready to give birth, supernatural Baptism of the Holy Ghost,
   which puts you into service, he had to have an assembly, set in Church order, Bible order,
   shepherds to take care of them. Because, now, they are in service. You can't be in the service…
   The Baptism of the Holy Ghost gives you Power to put you into service. You can't be in service
   unless you are in Bible order. Can you say, "Amen?"
   God has proven his men to you. Hasn't He? You’ve got confidence in them. And they
   have been approved of God and now, all is needed is to hear the sound of a rushing mighty
   Wind. And He’ll put every one of you that is sanctified and justified into service. God promised
   it.
   He said, "If you will draw nigh unto Me, I will draw nigh unto you." But He said,
   "You’ve robbed me." You say, "God, wherein did we rob You?" "Tithes and offerings. Tithes
   and offerings."

   146. Brother Branham, don’t you feel that everyone who claims to be a Christian should pay
   tithes, pay their tithes into the storehouse of the Lord? Please give Scripture to this question.
   
   52
   111 All right, if you will…That is right, that the Bible said in Malachi, the 4th chapter, “Will a
   man rob God? And you say, ‘Where have’ you ‘robbed Thee?’ In tithe and offerings. Bring all
   of your tithe and offerings into My storehouse, and prove Me,” saith the Lord, “if I will not
   open up the windows of Heaven, and pour out a blessing that there’ll not be room enough to
   receive.” 112 That’s a challenge to any individual! And if I only had the time, and would not get
   to this little Scripture that I wish to get to in about the next ten minutes, I would like to give you
   a personal testimony of how that I was even hungry, and my mother and them hungry, and my
   daddy sick, but I took my tithes out first and give it to God, and you ought to see what
   happened. I have never seen in my life, that any man or a woman, that if you only make one
   dollar a week, will bring the ten cents of that money and put it into your storehouse, or a church
   where you come, if God don’t bless that call me a hypocrite. Yes, sir. That’s a challenge to
   anybody. And every Christian…That goes to this other question. Every Christian should pay
   tithes! That’s right. It should be done.
   SO, DRAW NIGH UNTO GOD. And the way that this Scripture is read here, then, the
   only way that you could draw nigh unto God then would be in Bible order and pay your tithes
   and your offerings into that assembly. Come on now! He said, "Wherein have you robbed Me, in
   tithes and offerings?" You said, "Lord, draw nigh unto me." And He said, "Draw nigh unto Me."
   Where to get in Bible order. Did He not?
   Put your tithes and your offerings in that storehouse. AND HE SAID, "AND SEE
   WHETHER OR NOT THE LORD GOD WILL POUR A BLESSING DOWN UPON THAT
   ASSEMBLY THAT YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO CONTAIN IT." Did He not say it?
   What else, we find that Peter had the keys to the Kingdom. He received his great Baptism
   of Power. Then, immediately that whole Church went into action. They went into work for the
   Lord, when all the three thousand lambs cried out, "Men and brethren, how are we gonna get that
   which you got?"
   Acts 2:37-47-Reference quote:
   37 Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the
   rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do?
   38 Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus
   Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.
   39 For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as
   many as the Lord our God shall call.
   40 And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this
   untoward generation.
   41 Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added
   unto them about three thousand souls.
   42 And they continued stedfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of
   bread, and in prayers.
   43 And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles.
   44 And all that believed were together, and had all things common;
   45 And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need.
   
   53
   46 And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to
   house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart,
   47 Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily
   such as should be saved.
   He said, "Repent and be baptized, every one of you in the Name of Jesus Christ and ye
   shall receive the blessings. For it is unto you and to your children and as many as the Lord our
   God shall call." Is, that right?
   Three thousand lambs born in that day because they believed the word, they were
   sanctified. Remember, He said, "Lovest thou Me, Peter? Feed My sheep. Feed My sheep."
   All right. Peter got that love that Christ required to feed His sheep. Is, that right? He fed
   them there on the Day of Pentecost. Did they eat it? Did they eat it? Did God give them
   water? Yes, He did.
   While Peter went upon the house top, one day, Church had been moving on then, had an
   apostolic Church. Upon the house top one day, to pray, and he got hungry. He fell into a trance,
   saw a sheet come down from heaven, had all kinds of unclean animals in it, that the Jews wasn't
   supposed to eat. Voice came and said, "Peter, rise and eat." Said, "Lord, thou knowest that I have
   never ate anything unclean." Voice came out and says, "Peter, what God has cleansed, no matter
   how humble it may be, callest thou not unclean." Peter repented.
   Acts 10:9-15-Reference quote:
   9 On the morrow, as they went on their journey, and drew nigh unto the city, Peter went up upon
   the housetop to pray about the sixth hour:
   10 And he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while they made ready, he fell into a
   trance,
   11 And saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending unto him, as it had been a great
   sheet knit at the four corners, and let down to the earth:
   12 Wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping
   things, and fowls of the air.
   13 And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill, and eat.
   14 But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean.
   15 And the voice spake unto him again the second time, What God hath cleansed, that call
   not thou common.
   6 This was done thrice: and the vessel was received up again into heaven.
   17 Now while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean, behold,
   the men which were sent from Cornelius had made enquiry for Simon's house, and stood before
   the gate,
   18 And called, and asked whether Simon, which was surnamed Peter, were lodged there.
   The same time he was repenting there to God, the Spirit said, "Peter, three men seek
   thee." Said, "Ask nothing but go with them." He come down and housed the men and they went
   up to a man that was suffering in his heart because of prejudice. Because there was a segregation
   problem.

   Acts 10:19-23-Reference quote:
   19 While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him, Behold, three men seek thee.
   20 Arise therefore, and get thee down, and go with them, doubting nothing: for I have sent them.
   21 Then Peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from Cornelius; and said,
   Behold, I am he whom ye seek: what is the cause wherefore ye are come?
   22 And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and one that feareth God, and of good
   report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned from God by an holy angel to send for thee
   into his house, and to hear words of thee.
   23 Then called he them in, and lodged them. And on the morrow Peter went away with them,
   and certain brethren from Joppa accompanied him.
   When Peter come in and seen that they were Gentiles, he must have known what was in
   the heart of God. This humble minister-to-be probably, maybe he was called to be a minister, I
   don't know, fell down at the apostle's feet. This humble man said, "Rise up," said, "I am just a
   man, like you."
   Acts 10:24-27-Reference quote:
   24 And the morrow after they entered into Cæsarea. And Cornelius waited for them, and had
   called together his kinsmen and near friends.
   25 And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshipped
   him.
   26 But Peter took him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man.
   27 And as he talked with him, he went in, and found many that were come together.
   Said, "For what intent did you send for me? For I have seen a vision. And a voice spoke
   out and said, 'God has no segregation. God is not prejudiced. What God is going to cleanse by
   the Baptism of the Holy Ghost and tabernacle Himself down inside these people, callest thou not
   unclean.'"
   Acts 10:28-36-Reference quote:
   28 And he said unto them, Ye know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to
   keep company, or come unto one of another nation; but God hath shewed me that I should not
   call any man common or unclean.
   29 Therefore came I unto you without gainsaying, as soon as I was sent for: I ask therefore for
   what intent ye have sent for me?
   30 And Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting until this hour; and at the ninth hour I
   prayed in my house, and, behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing,
   31 And said, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight
   of God.
   32 Send therefore to Joppa, and call hither Simon, whose surname is Peter; he is lodged in the
   house of one Simon a tanner by the sea side: who, when he cometh, shall speak unto thee.
   33 Immediately therefore I sent to thee; and thou hast well done that thou art come. Now
   therefore are we all here present before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God.
   
   55
   34 Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of
   persons:
   35 But in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him.
   36 The word which God sent unto the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ: (he is
   Lord of all:)
   SO, GOD, BY HIS INFINITE MERCY, BY HIS LOVE, TO A HEART THAT WAS
   CRYING OUT TO HIM… Angel said unto Cornelius when he was praying, though he was
   suffering because the Jews said that they couldn't receive life from God, cause God only dealt
   with the Jews.
   My Brother, when you think that you are so uppity and mighty that God is going to use
   you and nobody else, God will take the foolish things, the things that are naught, to bring
   fellowship with Him. MANY FEEL LIKE, MAYBE FEEL LIKE THEY WASN'T CALLED OF
   GOD, BUT GOD SENT AN ANGEL AND SAID, "YOUR ALMS AND YOUR PRAYERS
   HAVE COME UP BEFORE GOD AS A MEMORIAL."
   Oh, if you only knew what this assembly was a doing, reaching out by the grace of God,
   you would faint this morning, some of you. God said, "GO AND SEND FOR ONE WHO IS
   ABLE TO UNLOCK THE KINGDOM OF GOD TO YOU, he has the keys and he has that
   love."
   And it said that, "While Peter yet spake these words the Holy Ghost fell upon them all
   and they received the Holy Ghost, like they did in the beginning.” Is, that right? Think of it,
   Friend. We’re going to have another Pentecost, right here. You believe it and see if God don't do
   it. Only believe it!
   The only... You say, "Brother Lambert, I want to be a lamb. I want that New-Birth,
   Brother Lambert. I want to be truly born of the Spirit of God, baptized into service. What am I
   going to do, Brother Lambert, it is so confusing?" I’ll tell you what God tells you to do. The only
   place to find Christ, in that kind of experience… Let me say the best place to find it...
   There was one said of a great man of God, he said, "I want to move with God, what can I
   do?" He said, "Find out where God is moving and get in there and move with Him." You want a
   cool drink? Get down where the creeks are flowing. If you want to get dry, just get off
   somewhere where it’s dry. If you want to get wet, get where it’s raining.
   The only place to find Christ…and I will tell ya, the best place, the perfect will place, to
   find Christ in that kind of baptismal experience, is to get in God's Bethlehem, God's manger,
   God's sheepcote.
   Remember, what I said them five things that we learned now. God's sheepcote; a local
   assembly that has Church order, that’s contending for the faith that was once delivered to the
   Saints, that is believing unto the Baptism of the Holy Ghost. You stay in there.
   Then God said, "I the great Shepherd, will feed you. I will lead you to the waters where
   you can drink." Is, that right? Come to that assembly who has a divine God-called shepherd, that
   is spiritual enough to watch out for the devil where he is trapping you and rebuke these things
   out of the midst. Church order, paying your tithes and your offerings. Is, that right? Reaching out
   and helping the poor in other places of the world.
   Did not God say in that day, "Blessed are you, you clothed me, you fed me, you gave Me
   drink." Come on, he said it. And he said, "You have robbed God in not bringing your tithes and
   
   56
   your offerings into your assembly. Return to that apostolic order, return to that apostolic way and
   I’ll pour you out a blessing of the Holy Ghost you’ll not be able to contain it."
   Brother said this morning, Brother Hunt on the way, said, "Brother Bob, if the people
   only knew how God was getting ready to bless them..." Oh, and the Holy Spirit just come down
   on me Oh boy, it is wonderful. I just stayed real still and just felt him moving, I said, "Thank
   You, Jesus."
   God said that he’d do it! God said he would give you the Holy Ghost. God's Word,
   Pillar of Fire, is on the earth. His power, his word is power unto salvation to everyone that can
   believe it.
   It is the power of God, no matter who preaches it. I don't care if he has got a head as a
   bushel of basket and one eye in the middle. If he’ll preach God's Word, God will be there in that
   Word. God's Spirit is in the Word and God’ll baptize you with the Holy Ghost.
   Remember the question, "Brother Lambert, I want to be a lamb." Find God's Bethlehem
   assembly that is made out of nothing but bread. All they got in there is just word bread, that’s
   all. No carnal fellowship at all, just God's word bread.
   Now, remember, first to be born as a lamb, first there has to be sheep. There has to be
   some sheep that are already sheep before that they can give birth to a lamb. Is that not
   right? First, there has to be a ram, then there has to be at least one sheep before another one
   could be born.

   31 And that’s about the way our churches has got, just took in a bunch under cold formal
   profession, some mystic dance or some sensation. And what do they do? Disbelieve the Word, till
   we got just a nest full of rotten eggs. It’s time to clean the nest and start over again. Until they
   come in contact with the Male, Christ Jesus, and get borned again of the Word. Then they got
   to hatch, because it’s Life.

   But if that female bird hasn’t been in contact with the male bird, they’ll never hatch. She’s got to
   be in the male. 182 It reminds me of churches today. Sometimes we can build the most prettiest
   church, we got so, and have the best lot of deacons and everything else like that; and a big
   congregation, the mayor of the city, and everybody coming to it, and bragging about it. But if
   THEY HAVEN’T BEEN IN CONTACT WITH THE NEW BIRTH, WITH THE MALE,
   CHRIST, YOU’VE GOT A NEST FULL OF ROTTEN EGGS. THEY’LL LAY THERE AND
   ROT, EVERY ONE OF THEM. 183 What we need today is a good old-fashion nest cleaning,
   all the way from Presbyterians, Baptists, all the way down, Pentecost and all. You’ve got to
   come in contact with Jesus Christ, Life. He is the One. The hen can lay an egg, but it will not
   hatch unless she’s been with the male bird. 184 And God Almighty, God the Father,
   overshadowed the virgin Mary, and created in her womb a Blood cell which brought forth the
   
   57
   Son of God without a sexual desire. And that Blood was shed at Calvary. Hallelujah! That is
   the Blood that I trust in, tonight, when there’s nothing. “No other fount I know, nothing but
   the Blood of Jesus.” Therefore, the Blood of God saves us. The Blood of God brings Jesus
   Christ in our midst. The Blood of God brings the Holy Ghost. Not the blood of a Jew or a
   Gentile; but God’s Own creative Blood. Jesus, the Man, was His Son that He created Himself,
   and God tabernacled in that tabernacle.
   So, God has given a few of us the Baptism of the Holy Ghost, so that we could get with
   the ram, the Word of God, Jesus Christ in Bible order. And then the Bible said, "When Zion
   travaileth she brought forth lambs." Ben, you believe that, don’t you?
   Isaiah 66:8-Reference quote:
   8 Who hath heard such a thing? who hath seen such things? Shall the earth be made to bring
   forth in one day? or shall a nation be born at once? for as soon as Zion travailed, she brought
   forth her children.
   All right, he said get with the ram, you are pregnated by the word. Is, that right? All your
   wool is sanctified and clean by the Blood of Jesus Christ, by the preaching of the word. Now,
   some sheep is getting ready to give birth to some lambs. You’ve got the 'House of God's Bread'
   the manger, where they can be born.
   You say, "Oh, Brother Lambert, but I want to born out in the snow in the cold." Well, if
   you want to be born out in the snow and in the cold, that’s up to you. But if I were you, I would
   come in where it is nice and pleasant, in God's house where the bread is being fed, where there is
   a provender and plenty of straw, wheat to eat upon. Is, that right? You want to be born out in the
   wilderness? That’s a foolish thing to say. Come into that hedge or a wall. Come into that home of
   God, that temple of men...
   Oh, my, I just thought of something. The Bible said, "You come into a habitation, a
   temple of God, where the spirits of just men... (Brother Lambert knocks on the pulpit four time)
   “WHERE THE SPIRITS OF JUST MEN ARE MADE PERFECT BY THE PREACHING OF
   THE WORD."
   Hebrews 12:22-25-Reference quote:
   22 But ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly
   Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,
   23 To the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven, and to God
   the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect,
   24 And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that
   speaketh better things than that of Abel.
   25 See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For if they escaped not who refused him that
   spake on earth, much more shall not we escape, if we turn away from him that speaketh from
   heaven:
   Contending for the faith, you come into that place, Sister, my dear, to be filled with the
   Holy Ghost, a house of God, a habitation of God where He dwells because God is where his
   word is preached. God is where His Word is preached! This is the little Bethlehem, manger.
   
   58
   Jude 1:3-Reference quote:
   3 Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation, it was needful
   for me to write unto you, and exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which
   was once delivered unto the saints.
   Ephesians 2:20-22-Reference quote:
   20 And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being
   the chief corner stone;
   21 In whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord:
   22 In whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit.
   Now, I ask you, when are sheep born? What time of year are they born? In the winter? In
   the wilderness when you are wandering around, to and fro by every wind of doctrine? Come
   now. When are they born? In the winter? When you’re rocking to and fro and not grounded in
   the apostolic order, Church order? Running here and running there? Is a lamb born in
   flight? No! Neither is it born in winter. It is born in the spring. This is spring time now. Lambs
   are born in April, this is April. They’ve been up all winter long.
   The Bible said that the shepherds tended their sheep, in the hills of Judaea, in the
   spring. Is, that right? The lambs were not born out in the hills in the winter time. But the true
   shepherd brought them into a hedge or a wall, the winter, trials and tribulations and fed yea,
   WHERE THE TRUE BREAD IS COME DOWN FROM HEAVEN.
   In this hedge or a wall, with a true shepherd, a temple of men, a house of God, a pleasant
   place because He loves you. Before the world, He loved you and He wants to bring you to
   Himself. A peculiar people. That word peculiar means, God's own private possession. You’re
   his, he died for you, he sent you shepherds here in this assembly, he has fed you through the
   winter with the word of God.
   Now, its spring. This is Palm Sunday, when Jesus, the King Shepherd, the Lamb of God,
   came riding in. Oh, hallelujah! Glory to God! May He come riding in this morning, on the wings
   of the Holy Ghost and seal every one of these lambs here this morning.

   211 I laid my hands against the rock and looked up towards Heaven and started praying. I heard
   a Voice coming out of the top of the rocks there, said, “What are you leaning against, over your
   heart?” And I raised back like this, my bare shoulders; naked from my waist up, hot. I looked
   back. And there was wrote in the quartz, in the stone, “White Eagle”; just exactly what the
   vision said that the next Message would come forth by. 212 I was so excited, I run home; got a
   camera and come back the next day, and took the picture of it. It was still there, wrote in the
   rock: “White Eagle.” (Dove leading eagle.)

   63-0317E - The Breach Between The Seven Church Ages And The Seven Seals
   William Marrion Branham
   This is Seven Seals on the Book. And the Book will not, the Seals will not be released until the
   Message of the seventh angel. See? So we—we are presuming; but the genuine revelation of
   God will be made perfect in that sounding, vindicated Truth. Now, that’s exactly what the Word
   says, “The mystery should be finished at that time.” 50 And this Seven-Seal Book, remember, It
   was closed here, in Revelation the 5th chapter, and in Revelation the 10th chapter It is opened.
   51 And now we’re going to see what the Book says about how It become open. And is not made
   known until the Lamb takes the Book, and breaks the Seals, and opens the Book. See? The
   Lamb has got to take the Book. 52 It’s hid. Now remember, “No man in Heaven, no man in
   earth,” pope, bishop, cardinal, state presbyter, or whoever he is, “can break them Seals, or
   reveal the Book, but the Lamb.” And we have probed, and presumed, and stumbled, and
   wondered, and—and that’s the reason we’re all in such a confusion. 53 BUT WITH THE
   DIVINE PROMISE THAT THIS BOOK OF REDEMPTION WILL BE PERFECTLY
   OPENED BY THE LAMB, AND THE SEALS THEREOF WILL BE LOOSED BY THE
   LAMB, IN THE LAST DAYS IN WHICH WE’RE LIVING NOW. AND IS NOT MADE
   KNOWN UNTIL THE LAMB TAKES THE BOOK AND BREAKS THE SEALS. Because,
   remember, the Book was being holded in the hands of Him that sat upon the Throne. “And the
   Lamb comes to Him that sits upon the Throne, and takes the Book out of His right hand.” Takes
   the Book! Oh, that’s deep. We’ll try to solve it out if we can, by the help of the Holy Spirit. Now
   we’re depending on Him. And we will see, later, it is at the end time, “When time has run out.”
   54 No denominations has a right for interpretation of the Book. No man has a right to interpret
   It. IT IS THE LAMB WHO INTERPRETS IT. AND THE LAMB IS THE ONE WHO
   SPEAKS IT, AND THE LAMB MAKES THE WORD TO BE KNOWN, BY VINDICATING
   AND BRINGING THE WORD TO LIFE. See? Exactly! Notice. And is not revealed until… 55
   This Book is not revealed until the church ages and denominational ages has run out, “and there
   is time no more.” See it? It’s only revealed after church ages and denominational ages has run
   out. 56 That’s the reason the thing is in such a scruple tonight. See, they pick up a little doctrine,
   and they run off here to one side, say, “This is It!” Another one picks up another doctrine, runs
   off this side, said, “This is It!” And each one builds a denomination under it, until we got
   hundreds of denominations. But still, in all of it, to see the confusion, the people are
   wondering, “What is Truth?” If that isn’t just the condition today! 57 But then He promises,
   that, “When that time has finished out, there will be the sounding of the seventh angel’s voice,
   and then the Book will be revealed, see, at that time.”
   It’s April. You are pregnated. You’re travailing, you want to give birth to a lamb, don't
   you? Glory to God! Here and here alone is God's provided way. And if a man or a woman
   would try to come up any other way than subjection to Divine Church order, he is like a thief and
   a robber. "How comest thou in hither, Friend, having not the wedding garment on?"
   
   60
   Matthew 22:11-13-Reference quote:
   11 And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man which had not on a wedding
   garment:
   12 And he saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment?
   And he was speechless.
   13 Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast him
   into outer darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

   55-0123A - The Approach To God
   William Marrion Branham
   62 Look, before they could see miracles, they had to come the provided approach. Before they
   could see the Red Sea open, they had to be a partaker of the glory… Notice. Before they could
   become a partaker of the glory, they had to come the provided approach to God to be a—a
   partaker of the vine—Divine approach, or the Divine articles. And before you can ever become a
   partaker of this blessed heavenly calling, you have to come through the provided approach, not
   self-sustaining, not intellectually, but death to yourself, and a reborn again in Christ Jesus
   through the offering of the Blood. Then… 63 You say, “My, why didn’t I know these things a
   long time ago?” You were trying to come through your church. You was trying to come through
   your organization. You was trying to come through the auxiliary, or something another. You was
   trying to come through your own good works, through your merits. You’ll never see it. And
   you can’t approach it until you die out to those things, and come God’s provided way of
   approach, which is Jesus Christ, being filled with the Holy Spirit, God’s provided way for
   sinners to come. You’ll never be able to nurse from the Old Testament goodness and the New
   Testaments goodness. You will never be able to nurse joy, and peace, and satisfaction, and
   healing from your body. You’ll stand off and criticize, say, “Oh, it might been a long time ago,
   but I believe the approach is all dried up now.” Listen, if Christ is the approach to God, then
   God is El Shaddai. Amen. So come the provided way. Don’t try to bypass; come the provided
   way. 64 Beautiful parable, if we had time to go into it, of the wedding supper. How that the
   bridegroom give out the robes, and invited everybody. And robes made everybody look the
   same. They stood at a door. And as they come by giving their passes in the Orients and India,
   and so forth, very beautifully still carried on. They give out the robes. And everybody was
   invited, received a robe. I like that. So then… 65 When they come to the door, there was a man
   at the gate that took their invitation. They had on a robe when they come in. Come in another
   one, and another one come in. And then when they got in there, and the dinner was set, he
   found one that was there but didn’t have on the garment. What happened? It showed he come
   in a window, bypassed the door and come in another way. He didn’t come the provided
   approach, because the gate man would have turned him back. The robe makes them all look
   alike. Whether you are rich or poor, bond or free, when the robe goes on you, you look like the
   others. You can’t show off fancy clothes and everything when you got the robe on. 66 So then,
   it showed that he come in by a window, or come the back door, or bypassed the door. Jesus
   said, “Friend, what are you doing here?” And he was speechless. See, God’s got an approach,
   and we must come that approach. AND EVERY MAN THAT COMES THAT APPROACH,
   DIES TO SELF, COMES TO CHRIST, REGENERATED, BORN AGAIN, FILLED WITH
   
   61
   THE HOLY SPIRIT, THE ROBE OF GOD’S RIGHTEOUSNESS GIVEN UPON YOU, AND
   YOU LIVE FOR CHRIST FROM THEN ON. YOU’RE COMING GOD’S PROVIDED
   APPROACH.
   Jesus, Baptism of the Fire, the Holy Ghost is that wedding garment. He, Jesus, is standing
   in the river like John, the river of God's love and power. He’s waiting for you to come, this
   morning, and be Baptized down into that river, with His mighty love. Will you stand to your
   feet?
   Do you love Him? Hasn't He done all things well? Hasn't He provided everything for
   you? Why fear then? God is going to give you the Baptism of the Holy Ghost. Just be
   faithful. Come to God's house of bread, Bethlehem, where you will find it pleasant, when the
   times of the refreshing shall come from the Presence of the Lord.
   Sister dear, would you... could you play for us? We will sing, "Only Believe," because
   faith is the only way to receive that Lamb Birth, this morning. It’s by faith. By faith He’ll give it
   to you. God’s here! GOD PROMISED IT! "AND IN THE LAST DAYS I’LL POUR OUT MY
   SPIRIT UPON ALL FLESH." Did He promise it?
   Let us sing this out in faith. Let the great Holy Ghost fall on you, this morning. I’ll pray
   for you this week. I’ve cried out to God for you. I know that you’ve yearned for it. Now, it’s off
   my... I have preached it the best that I know how to preach it to you, that...
   God give me this message for you. God give it to me for you, now, believe it and see
   what happens. Let your faith rise as we sing this and let God seal you. Don't work up nothing
   false, just stay calm. Don't scream out, just make love to Him that He’s your Shepherd and see
   what will happen.
   "Only..." Your eyes closed, worshipping Him, the great Shepherd.
   Congregation continues song: “Only Believe”
   "Jesus’s here..." He’s here because He promised it. He’s here because His Word is
   preached here. This is God's manger, only sheep are here.
   Chorus: Jesus is Here; Lord, I believePastor speaks briefly. Assembly crying and praying. Leads song: Oh, The Blood of Jesus
   and speaks again.
   (Brother Bob speaks to pastor)
   Let us just...Real quietly, now. God is dealing with so many here, just now. We’re going
   to sing this one song, with love in our heart to our great Shepherd, now. God wants to bless you.
   We’re just going to sing this one song, "It Is No Secret What God Can Do."
   It is no secret what God can do,
   What He’s done for others (At Pentecost, now.)
   He’ll do for you.
   With arm’s wide (He loves you; He wants to do...)
   He’ll welcome you. (It is no secret.)
   It is no secret what God can do.

   you get ta thinking that, he’ll raise up somebody that you least expect to use, if you don't stay
   humble.
    So, I am very thankful to God for raising up Brother Perry Green. I can see the hand of the
   Lord in it. From the first time that Brother Perry Green told me the burden upon his heart, I knew
   it was of God and I said, "I believe that, I believe that’s the Lord and I believe God has ordained
   you to do this." I couldn't do it, and I know about all the ministers in this message, practically,
   most of them very personal, and I don't know a man in this message could do what God is going
   to do and is doing through Brother Perry. Neither do I believe that God could do through Brother
   Perry what He’s doin through Brother Lee Vayle, and so on and such forth.
    I believe that every person in the Body of Jesus Christ has a particular ministry given them by
   the Holy Ghost. And I don't believe that anybody could take their place. And I don't believe there
   is any big "You's" and little "Me's". I believe we’re all brothers and sisters in Christ Jesus loving
   one another.
    And I think we ought to be like a good ball team. I don't care how good of a ball carrier you
   are, you’re no good unless you have a guard and a tackle and a quarterback and everything that
   makes up a ball team. It takes a whole team. And I think that’s what’s needful in this hour, when
   a man is given the ball to carry by Jesus Christ, then you start blocking for him.
    So, I don't know what God used a little fellow like me for, but I tell you this, whatever it is, I
   want to be faithful in it. And I want to have the kind of a spirit that I could put myself into
   The Last Day Ministry
   
   2
   subjection to the least one of you here in this assembly. That’s the kind of spirit that I want. And,
   if I have any other spirit besides that, I need a little more prayer. Can you say, "Amen?" (amen)
   So, I am thankful to God, as I said before, for raising up Brother Green in this late hour to be a
   blessing to God's servant and to his people. And I know that God is getting ready to do a
   tremendous thing in the earth.
    So, I enjoyed our Brother's testimony. I’ve come to love our precious Brother McGhee. The
   Holy Spirit led me to Brother McGhee out in Arizona. I was looking at him in the meeting,
   something spoke to me and said, "That man’s sincere." And I kept a watching him and I and
   something said, "You’ve got to get to him." So, I got to him and I began to tell him little things
   that the Lord wanted him to know and we’ve become to be close friends and to love one another
   very much.
    And I am just thankful to be able to go to Arizona with that precious Brother McGhee and his
   family. Now if you will... I told Brother McGhee, I said, "I sure wish you would preach for us
   tonight." I don't preach much. You know how it is today, there is very few open doors but I am
   one of the ministers of the Local Christian Assembly.
    And I’d like to bring you greetings from our assembly in New York City which is a sister
   church to this church here. And I bring you greetings from those precious Brothers up there. And
   I am just thankful to be associated with that fine assembly in New York City.
   I hope someday, that you’ll be able to hear my pastors preach. I got three pastors now, Brother
   Perry Greene, Orlando Hunt and Joseph Coleman. Now, my other two pastors in New York City,
   have a little darker skin than I do and they’re a lot bigger than I am, too. One of them eats more
   than I do. But I tell ya, I’ve never found two men that was more spiritual, more dedicated and has
   more love than those two men in New York City. And truly, I believe with all of my heart that
   God is no respecter of persons. No siree! And I’m just thankful to see God working in anybody
   that will humble themselves before the Lord. It just tickles me to death to see Jesus using
   somebody. Amen?
    So, if you’ll open your Bibles, now to Ephesians 4. The Lord kinda laid this little thought
   upon my heart. Actually, it’s not a thought, I’d just like to a kinda, maybe, that I could say
   something to help you, you know? Knowing that a lot of you are new in the message and maybe
   I could say something, that maybe you hadn't hardly seen it on this way before and maybe you
   had. But it would be good to...
    The Word of God is good, any way that you want to bring it. And a lot of times it’s just good
   to keep going over these things to make sure we get them.
    So, let’s just bow our heads in a word of prayer. I’d like to kinda trust the Lord Jesus to help
   me since I’m... I don't preach much and I was telling Brother McGhee, I said, "I’ll tell ya, a
   preacher needs to preach or it’s just like preaching all over again for the first time." So, you be
   praying for me, tonight, and I’ll appreciate it very much.
    Opening Prayer: Brother Lambert
    Our Heavenly Father, we thank you for this Local Christian Assembly here in Beaumont,
   Texas, Father. Where the message and the truth of the final hour of this age, Lord. And we just
   thank you, God, that there is a lighthouse now in Beaumont where You can lead your sheep into
   the fold, Father, where you may make their souls fat with the good Word of the Lord. Now,
   Father, we pray that you’d bless every heart here, tonight. We pray that you’d refresh our spirits,
   Lord, with the precious Word of God. Now, Lord, how I pray that you would forgive me of my
   The Last Day Ministry
   
   3
   sins, Lord, and help me, Lord God, to be a blessing to my Brothers and Sisters, tonight, that by
   the Holy Ghost, Lord, you might make me an able minister of the gospel of Jesus Christ,
   tonight. We give you all the praise for it, Lord. In Jesus Name. Amen.
    So, much that I could say, that I’d like to say and don't have time to say it. Several messages
   that I would like to... I thought might help you but I kept a praying and waiting on the Lord and
   this kinda come upon my heart. I’d like to preach to you a little bit, on "The Last Day
   Ministry." And we read here in God's precious Word; Ephesians 4:12 or 4:11 rather. It says;
   Ephesians 4:11-13-Scripture Reading;
   11 And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors
   and teachers;
   12 For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of
   Christ:
   13 Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a
   perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:
    Now, sooner or later, when you begin to travel around in the meetings of the messenger of
   this hour, you’re goin to run on too many interpretations of this message that God has given to
   this man called, William Branham, which we know to be the Seventh Angel Messenger to the
   last Church Age that we’re living in, called the Laodicean Church Age. Many interpretations of
   this message. And one interpretation is that there is no five-fold ministry. That--that has been
   done away with because, "That which is perfect is come now and that which is in part is done
   away with."
   1 Corinthians 13:9-10-Reference quote:
   9 For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.
   10 But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away.
    And there are no more gifts of the Spirit. We don't need them anymore because we have the
   perfect resurrected Christ working among us in the perfect manifestation of the Son of God,
   made flesh.
    Now, I would like to prove tonight by God's Word that there has been no five-fold ministry
   in operation since the days of the apostles. There has been no God called, God sent, God
   anointed five-fold ministry such as was on the day of Pentecost. There could not have been
   because of one fact, that God never sends a messenger, ministers, without the truth. Because the
   Bible says, “that ye have been “begotten by the word of truth.”
   James 1:18-Reference quote:
   18 Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of
   his creatures.

    So, we know that the truth of the apostles died during the Dark Ages and was resurrected in
   Martin Luther. And that has brought us down to this last hour when God promised, in Malachi 4,
   that there would come a restoration back to the true God-called, elected people before the
   foundation of the world. That they would receive…that they would receive a prophet according
   to Malachi 4, that would restore all things that the palmerworm, that the locust and the caterpillar
   had eaten. That God would restore everything that was given to the early Pentecostal Church that
   this worm had eaten up. And we know that this was one worm which was the antichrist, working
   in these different ages.

   43 And we realize that, in the Scriptures, over in Malachi 4, there is to be a one like John, an—
   an Elijah to whom the Word of God can come to. And he is to reveal, by the Holy Spirit, all the
   mysteries of God, and restore the Faith of the children back to the faith of the apostolic
   fathers, RESTORE BACK all these mysteries that’s been probed at, through these
   denominational years. Now, that’s what the Word said. I’m just responsible for what It said.
   See? It’s, It’s written, is right. That’s what It is. 44 Now, we see that this Seven-Seal Book, now,
   is the mystery of redemption. It’s a Book of Redemption, from God. 45 Now, all the mysteries,
   at this time, should be finished AT THE SOUNDING OF THIS MESSENGER. Now, here is
   the angel on earth; and “ANOTHER” ANGEL, MIGHTY MESSENGER, COME DOWN.

   211 Look to the promise of this hour, what we’re living in; a rejected Light. What did they?
   They rejected It back there. Why? They was living in a glare. What are they doing today? Same
   thing. 212 Well, are—are you a Christian? “I’m a Lutheran. I’m a Baptist. I’m Presbyterian.”
   That don’t mean one thing. Just might say you was a “hog, pig,” or anything else you want to
   call yourself. See? That, that’s about how much it means. Now no—no disregards to you, but if
   you’re taking it to its fundamental part, that’s right. I asked the question, “A Christian?” That’s
   Christ in you. And if Christ is in you, then the Word is in you. And then if the Word is in you,
   when the Light is shining, how you going to walk out of It? See, that’s the question. That’s

   what’s in now, the Light. The evening Light’s shining. The Bride Tree is blooming. 213 Oh,
   remember, they pruned that old Tree. “And what the cankerworm left, the palm—palmworm eat;
   and what the palmworm left, the caterpillar eaten.” What the Methodist left, the Baptist eaten;
   what the Baptist left, the Pentecostal eaten. He said, “This Tree was,” Joel there, “was cut all
   down to a stump,” BUT HE WANTED TO KNOW IF IT WOULD LIVE AGAIN. OH, YEAH!
   HE RESERVED THAT TREE. HE RESERVED THAT TREE, YES, SIR, FOR IT WAS HIS
   BRIDE. AND HE SAID, “‘I WILL RESTORE,’ SAITH THE LORD.” WHAT IS IT? “I’LL
   BRING IT FORTH, ALL THAT THE LUTHERAN EAT, AND THE WESLEYAN EAT, AND
   ALL THEM. AND I WILL RESTORE IT, ’CAUSE IT’S ALL STILL IN THE ROOT OF
   THE TREE.” See?
   
    Now, we have just now received the restoration message of Malachi 4. That message has
   almost been completed. The mysteries of the Bible, of the doctrines that the apostles have
   preached, has been restored to the people that God has called out of these different
   denominations.

   a nation, God will bring the Bride out of a church. The Bride will be called from all the
   churches. It’ll be the elected of God, will be brought out. And we’re on the verge of that
   exodus right now, for we have every Scriptural proof that we’re standing there. Now, I know
   that’s been said a lot of times, but, my friend, one time it’ll be said for the last time. TIME WILL

   William Marrion Branham
   243 God has always counted character, not members. And today we do vice versa. We count
   members, good dress, well payers, instead of character. Uh-huh. 244 Eliezer sweated it out,
   until he found character. That’s right. Who would he get? And he trusted God. Character for
   what? Character for Isaac, the bride, which the Church is type of. You know that. That was the
   natural seed of Abraham; this is the royal Seed of Abraham. Well, if Eliezer, the messenger
   hunting the bride and trying to find character, if that man is come, a messenger of the last
   day, TRYING TO FIND THE BRIDE FOR CHRIST, he will not look for a denominational
   membership. He will look for character that’s willing. 245 Watch! Good character first, then to
   get her ready to meet Isaac. After he found the character, THEN GET HER STAND STILL
   LONG ENOUGH TO LISTEN TO HIS MESSAGE of Isaac. 246 That’s the messenger of the
   The Last Day Ministry
   
   6
   last days, the evening Light, is first find that Church (WHERE WILL THEY BELIEVE THE
   MESSAGE?), hunt it. Can you read what I’m talking about? Hunt where that Church is that’ll
   even let you come in, that won’t close the door in your face. And then when you do there, then
   you’ve found character. Now if she will stand still long enough to tell her how that Bride’s got
   to be dressed! She’s got to be clothed. Stand still! If she could get… 247 Look at the little
   Rebekah listening to every word, her little heart was beating. She…He—he was telling her. Now,
   you’ve sweated it out, “Where will I go?” until I find the character. Then when I find the
   character, then make her stand still long enough to get her ready to go to meet him. Oh, my,
   what a striking thing! (Wish we had a little more time on that clock.) GET HER READY;
   STAND STILL TO LISTEN TO HIS MESSAGE OF HIM. Eliezer wasn’t speaking of hisself,
   but he was speaking of the one he was sent from. And he had the gifts to prove that he was sent
   from him. Amen! He wanted to clothe her with these things. You know how he fixed her up. 248
   If I could just get her to wash her face! See? You know, I—I just felt checked on that, so I better
   keep still. Anyhow, I’ve said enough, you know what I’m talking about. All right, listen, just
   stand still. 249 NOTICE, THE END-TIME MESSENGER, HIS JOB WILL BE TO GET THE
   SAINTS READY, THE BRIDE READY FOR THE BRIDEGROOM. THAT WILL BE HIS
   MESSAGE. Now you want to learn ABC’s so you can study algebra later? When these other
   SEALS ON THE BACK IS OPENED THEY’LL ONLY BE REVEALED TO THEM. That’s
   right. Learn ABC first. What is ABC? “Always Believe Christ,” (not your creed), Christ. See?
   Believe what He says, not what somebody else says. 250 If it’s contrary, if a man tells you, “It’s
   all right for you to cut your hair, women,” you know he’s lying. The Bible says it’s wrong. If he
   says, “You can be deacon and still have four or five wives,” he’s lying. That’s contrary to the
   Word. See? All these other things that we speak of, call it to the Word and see if it’s the Word
   right. 251 Bring back the church to the Word. Now, what is this messenger of Malachi 4 to do?
   Restore back the original Faith, the resurrection Faith. That, they seen Jesus after He had
   raised from the dead, seen Him working among them. 252 They were men of few words. They
   went forth and preached the Word. Oh, they preached long, Paul preached all night one time.
   See? A man fell out of the building, killed himself. He laid his body over him, brought him back
   to life again, see. See? See, kept on preaching. 253 Now, notice they were different man than
   what the Ph., L.L., Q.U.S.T., and ever what you want to call it, is today. What? Separates the
   messenger and…The Message, rather, by the messenger, will separate the believers from
   unbelievers. Some of them will line to It, and some won’t. Some of the Lutheran… Some of the
   Catholic lined to Luther, some didn’t. Some of the Lutherans lined to Methodist, some didn’t.
   Some lines to Pentecost, and some won’t. Some will line with the evening Light, some won’t. 254
   How you going to know whether it’s evening Light or not? Test it with the Word (not just one
   Word, ALL THE WORD PUT TOGETHER), see whether it’s right or not. Oh, what is it in?
   Then if this Message bears forth the vindication of God performing what He said He would
   do, AND IT’S LINED WITH THE WORD, THEN THE WORD IS VINDICATED LIKE
   OTHER TIMES AND OTHER PROPHETICS DID. 255 Notice when the
   Message…when…Notice when the Message is rejected by the people, and the messenger
   SEEMS to be completely defeated, he can’t get another door, he can’t get a place.
   
    So, therefore, there could not have been a five-fold ministry in operation by the Holy Ghost
   until God had first restored the main thing which was the word of God. Because the truth of
   The Last Day Ministry
   
   7
   God's word preached by the anointing of the Holy Ghost brings back apostolic days and that
   only.
    Now, we have had all kinds of churches and denominations have tried to produce an
   Apostolic Church. We have one organization namely, United Pentecostal, which claims to be
   The Apostolic Church of the Book of Acts. But we know that it’s not so. Many have made this
   claim, that they, when they group these men together, when they found the truth, that they were
   going to have an assembly just like the Apostolic Church.

   An Exposition Of The Seven Church Ages - 4 - The Smyrnaean Church Age
   William Marrion Branham
   If you think that is an exaggeration, read all of II Timothy chapter 3 and the first five verses of
   the 4th chapter. II Timothy 4:1-5, “I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus
   Christ, Who shall judge the quick and the dead at His appearing and His kingdom; preach the
   Word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long-suffering and
   doctrine. For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own
   lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears; and they shall turn away
   their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables. But watch thou in all things, endure
   afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry.” When the church
   allowed herself to move away from the original, like Adam and Eve, death set in. There is no
   strength in her. She has become a monstrosity. The minute the church moved toward form and
   ceremony, and toward priesthood by organizing the ministers into a group that decided
   leadership apart from the Holy Spirit and His Word, that very moment death entered and she
   started to get sick, and as she got sick she changed to a powerless group of people whose only
   weapon was argument. She could produce nothing in the Spirit, for her hopes were built on
   program and not on faith in His Word. They sowed program so they reaped program. They
   sowed perversion so they reaped perverted children. You tamper with God and you reap
   exactly what you injected. Man ought to learn that from nature. He has tampered with nature.
   He has injected his own ideas into nature and rearranged the molecules, etcetera, and now he is
   reaping a whirlwind. Just look how they have bred the chicken. It is so highly bred that it is a
   laying machine that lays itself out. It is no good for food and is soft and poor eating. They inject
   substances into the meat we eat and because of that the human body is changing so that women
   are getting narrower in the hips and broader of shoulder and men are getting just the opposite.
   Now if you fool with nature and get a monstrosity and a backfire, what will happen if you
   change the truth into a lie? The answer is, you will breed an antichrist, godless system of
   religion that is so perverted it will not look like or produce what the original did. The only
   answer that God has for a situation like that is the lake of fire. That poor Smyrnaean Age was
   dying. When it died, it never came back. No age ever comes back. No revival ever comes back. It
   can’t have the life of God in it by natural generation. It takes a regeneration from above. This
   last age started with the fires of a Pentecostal revival and they organized it right back. Instead
   of taking the Word they took their own ideas and did just what every age has done —
   substituted the manual for the Word. Just you step outside that manual and see what happens.
   You are out, brother. And they will persecute you and blame it on God. And how they love their
   organization. No wonder. They are second generation Pentecostals and since God doesn’t have
   grandchildren they are just children of their fathers, known by their creeds and form of worship.

   They can talk about what used to be, but they can’t produce it. Once they had the lightning but
   about all that is left is the thunder. But let them talk to you about the glories of their movement.
   They will say, “Yes sir, I want you to know that this is a move that no man started. It came
   spontaneously. The Spirit fell all over the world. Yes sir, we got what they had at Pentecost. This
   was not of men but of God.” THEN WHY DIDN’T THEY KEEP IT THAT WAY? IF GOD
   STARTED IT HOW COME GOD COULDN’T KEEP IT AND FINISH IT? If God didn’t
   write a handbook of creeds and formulas and dogmas to start it, then what right did they have to
   do that? God poured out His Spirit upon Baptists, Methodists, Nazarenes, Adventists,
   Presbyterians, Brethren, Church of God (several so named), etcetera. All these brethren were
   brought up on different doctrines, by-laws, church manuals, etcetera. God swept it all to one
   side; He destroyed their dispensational theories and restored the gifts of the Spirit, proving He is
   the same yesterday and today and forever. But did those Pentecostals learn their lesson about
   organization? No sir. They organized right back and have written their own textbooks, by-laws
   and church manual, fellowship book, etcetera, with one idea in mind, which is to prove that they
   now have all the truth, know all the answers, and are therefore, the elite of God who know the
   way and can show it unto others as God’s appointed guides. But they haven’t got it. They have
   hybridized themselves like the very groups they came out of. If they want to be in the bride they
   are going to have to come out exactly as did their forefathers. They are like all the rest. The
   revival is over. They are trying to live a name and are dead. They took organization, all the
   while talking about the Spirit of God. They talk about the evidence of the Holy Spirit. But they
   forget that the devil can talk in tongues, too. The utter confusion of Babel is in their midst and
   they call it the Spirit of God. Once again we see man telling God, instead of God telling man.
   Now you might desire to scold me right here for what I have said. Alright. They call themselves
   Pentecostal and Full Gospel. Let them prove it. At Pentecost the fire came in a cloud and
   separated over each of them like a tongue, and fell on each one. Where is the fire? They spoke
   in tongues at Pentecost and the people who listened understood. Where is that? The whole
   multitude of believers acted like one family. Pentecostals are as badly divided as any group in
   history. No man durst join himself to the early church but only God added. They have as many
   goats among them as any. They claim to be full Gospel but they can’t prove it. Their churches
   are as empty of power as any of them. If they are full Gospel then we had better admit the Bible
   made a mistake when it describes the full Gospel men at Pentecost. They sing, “There’s been a
   great change in me.” They are right. But the change has not been for the better. It is time to get
   back to God. They have a name that they live but are dead. Tongues isn’t the evidence of
   revival. It is the evidence of death. Tongues proclaimed the evidence that the ceremonial
   religion of the Jews was over, that a new era had begun. Tongues today is ringing down the
   curtain on the Gentile church ages and the Gospel is going back to the Jews. People are talking
   about tongues heralding in a great Spiritual move. They have missed the boat. The truth is that
   it is writing the finish to all of man’s ideas, programs and kingdoms, and the kingdom of God is
   being ushered in. Wake up people of God. Wake up. If you don’t think this is true, just listen to
   this. All over the world in both Pentecostal and fundamental groups they are organizing the
   businessmen. They have invaded the pulpit without a call from God. They have styled
   themselves the fishers of men and the founders of a move of God, and they say the gifted ministry
   of Ephesians 4:10-13 that God gave the church has failed, so they are taking over. Here we are
   right in the midst of the fulfillment of prophecy, called the gainsayings of Korah, and they don’t
   even know that they have fulfilled it. They are blindly going on preaching experience for truth.
   May God have pity on them. May their eyes be opened before it is too late. Oh, listen to me.

   When did the prestige of money, social leadership, business ability, or sheer mental prowess ever
   qualify a man for spiritual leadership, or give any weight to the Word of God? And when in any
   way materiality or human values begin to show as the media by which God works instead of the
   Holy Spirit ALONE, then we are fighting against God, not for Him.
    But none has been able to produce this Apostolic Assembly because it was contrary to the
   word of God. God predestinated before the world that He would send a messenger in the last
   days that would turn us back to the faith of the doctrine of the apostles. Amen.

   61-1105 - The Testimony Of A True Witness
   William Marrion Branham
   228 We are a witness that the Word of God is fulfilled. The church is in that, every organization
   is in that same state right now. I’d…I’ll challenge any man to show me any organization on fire
   for God, filled with the Holy Ghost, with signs following them. Rise and tell me one, any
   organization! There is no such a thing. It’s not on the pages. That’s right. They’re all powerless
   and dead. Get it! 229 But He also prophesied there would be a real Church in that day, a little
   flock, a remnant. He said there would be, and there will be. “There will be a people who know
   their God,” said the prophet, “will do exploits in the last days.” 230 He said there would be
   evening Lights in the last day. The prophet said so! God’s true witness said so, “There would be
   evening Lights.” What is an evening Light? The same as the morning Light. The prophet said,
   “There will be a day where it wouldn’t be night or day,” a gloomy time like it is outside today,
   just enough light to see how to get around. But said, “In the evening time, it shall be Light.”
   What would it be? Roar, coming back, going back to the early time! “There would be evening
   Lights in the last day, shining.” 231 He said, “There would be a prophet rise in the last days,”
   Malachi 4, “giving the signs of the days of Lot, so forth, also prophesying for the people to
   return back, ‘Turn back to the Faith of the first pentecostal fathers! Turn back to the original!
   Turn back to the Bible! Get away from organization and denomination, and go back to the
   first! Go back to the original pentecost, to the original filling of the Holy Ghost, to the
   original Power of God!’” The Word testifies that that will happen.
    God said He would do it. And this restoration message would produce once again, apostolic
   assemblies around the world, with the gifts of the Holy Spirit in operation, with the power of
   God in operation that was able to reveal the sins of the people's heart. These great wonders and
   miracles worked and performed by little humble men and women where the power of the Holy
   Ghost rests upon the assembly as they gather together. And, oh, how our hearts have longed in
   this last hour to see an assembly, a church, rise up like was on the day of Pentecost.

   62-0121M - And Thy Seed Shall Possess The Gate Of His Enemy
   William Marrion Branham
   238 He ascended on High. What did He do? He cut a hole, a gate, that, the prayer of this Seed of
   Abraham. Why? Why? If we be the Body of Christ, if we are dead, we reckon ourself dead and
   buried in Christ, and raised with Him in resurrection. He is the Head of the Body. Where the
   Head is, the Body is with It. And then, this morning, where every one that’s did that, “is seated
   with Him in heavenly places,” with the Royal Seed. Praise God. 239 No gates. You can’t pray
   this far, and say, “Oh, oh, there’s a word.” Huh-uh. They close you off, right there. 240 But if
   our heart condemn us not; if we know that we’re walking in the commandments of God; we
   see our lives cleaned up; we see it; every Word that God commanded, we keep It; then the
   gates of every enemy is possessed. “Then ask what you will, it’ll be done for you.” “He shall
   possess the gate of his enemy.” Oh, brother, what a church that would be! 241 When I come
   back again to Phoenix, if the Lord permits me, I hope, when I walk into this tabernacle, that
   these pews will be lined, and every pew in the full Gospel movement in this city will be lined
   with saints of the living God: look like Christian; talk like Christian; act like Christians; with
   the Spirit of God moving among them, where, if one would sin, the Holy Spirit call it out right
   then. 242 It’ll do it. You seen it in the prayer line, as up here on the altar. Where, say, “You go
   back there and make that right with your husband. Go, tell your wife that you was out, night
   before last, with that woman, setting on a certain-certain place.” If It’ll do it here, by walking
   in the Word, listening to that still small Voice, It’ll do it in you. You’re Abraham’s Seed. Then,
   no sin. 243 Preacher, wouldn’t you like to see that in your church? Walk in this church, and
   look down along through here, see both men and women, godly, saintly, setting there just
   charged with the power of God. Sin could not walk in. A man walk in and set down, the Spirit
   raise up and say, “John Jones, you come from so-and-so, a city, a certain-certain place. He’s
   here to find healing for his body. See? He did a certain thing at a certain place. He did this,
   and he take…has, take this back, make this right, then God will heal him of that cancer.
   THUS SAITH THE LORD.” My, my! 244 Give me a church, give me ten men, who, really
   jewels of God, the Royal Seed, put them men together, and watch what’ll take place. Give me
   this little houseful of people like that, and I’ll show you a Light that the world will run to it.
   That’s right. That’s what God wants us to be. “You’re a city setting on a hill.” You’re Royal
   Seed of Abraham. “It shall possess the gate of its enemy.” 245 Sickness, there’s a cause for
   sickness. There’s a cause for these things. And God, the Holy Spirit, is here to reveal that thing
   and tell you why you don’t get it. WHAT’S THE MATTER WITH US? We don’t have to wonder,
   “Will It do it.” It’s already doing it. What do you do?
   
    But there could have never been one. All the efforts that you could have put forth, these
   men, have never been able to produce what was on the day of Pentecost because we had to
   receive the restoration word. And we could not get that only by this prophet that God promised
   us.
    So, now, we come down to this hour that we have now received the message that has
   promised infallibly to produce a ministry just like Jesus Christ, that will produce a Bride for the
   Lord Jesus Christ in this last hour. This messenger has produced and is producing a Bride for
   The Last Day Ministry

   the Lord Jesus Christ to marry. Amen. A Bride without spot, wrinkle or blemish. So, we have
   now the restoration message.

   An Exposition Of The Seven Church Ages - 5 - The Pergamean Church Age
   William Marrion Branham
   If the church, way back there in that third age had only held on to the revelation of the living
   Word in their midst, the power of God would not have faded as it did in those Dark Ages. And
   right today, when the church returns to the Word in faith, we can say without doubt that the
   glory of God and the wonderful acts of God will be in her midst again. One night as I was
   seeking the Lord, the Holy Spirit told me to pick up my pen and write. As I grasped the pen to
   write, His Spirit gave me a message for the church. I want to bring it to you. It has to do with
   the Word and the bride. Here is what I am trying to say to you. The law of reproduction is that
   each specie brings forth after its own kind, even according to Genesis 1:11, “And God said, Let
   the earth bring forth grass, and the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his
   kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.” Whatever life was in the seed came
   forth into a plant and thence into fruit. The very same law applies to the church today.
   Whatever seed started the church will come forth and be like the original seed because it is
   the same seed. IN THESE LAST DAYS THE TRUE BRIDE CHURCH (CHRIST’S SEED)
   WILL COME TO THE HEADSTONE, AND SHE WILL BE THE SUPER CHURCH, A
   SUPER RACE, AS SHE NEARS HIM. THEY IN THE BRIDE WILL BE SO MUCH LIKE
   HIM THAT THEY WILL EVEN BE IN HIS VERY IMAGE. THIS IS IN ORDER TO BE
   UNITED WITH HIM. THEY WILL BE ONE. THEY WILL BE THE VERY
   MANIFESTATION OF THE WORD OF THE LIVING GOD. Denominations cannot
   produce this (wrong seed). They will produce their creeds and their dogmas, mixed with the
   Word. This mongrelizing brings forth a hybrid product. The first son (Adam) was the spoken
   seed-Word of God. He was given a bride to reproduce himself. That is why the bride was
   given to him, to reproduce himself; to produce another son of God. But she fell. She fell by
   hybridization. She caused him to die. The second Son (Jesus), also a spoken Seed-Word of
   God was given a bride like as was Adam. But before He could marry her, she also had fallen.
   She, like Adam’s wife, was put to the test whether she would believe the Word of God and
   live, or doubt the Word and die. She doubted. She left the Word. She died. From a little group
   of the true seed of the Word, GOD WILL PRESENT CHRIST WITH A BELOVED BRIDE.
   SHE IS A VIRGIN OF HIS WORD. She is a virgin because she knows no man-made creeds
   or dogmas. By and through the members of the bride will be fulfilled all that was promised of
   God to be made manifest in the virgin. The word of promise came to the virgin Mary. But that
   Word of promise was He, Himself, to be made manifest. GOD WAS MADE MANIFEST. HE,
   HIMSELF, ACTED AT THAT TIME AND FULFILLED HIS OWN WORD OF PROMISE
   IN THE VIRGIN. It was an angel that had brought her the message. But the angel’s message
   was the Word of God. Isaiah 9:6. He fulfilled at that time all that was written of Him because
   she accepted His Word to her. The members of the virgin bride will love Him, and they will
   have His potentials, for He is their head, and all power belongs to Him. They are subject to
   Him as the members of our bodies are subject to our heads. Notice the harmony of the Father
   and the Son. Jesus never did anything until it was first showed Him by the Father. John 5:19.
   This harmony is now to exist between the Groom and His bride. HE SHOWS HER HIS
   The Last Day Ministry
   
   12
   WORD OF LIFE. SHE RECEIVES IT. SHE NEVER DOUBTS IT. THEREFORE,
   NOTHING CAN HARM HER, NOT EVEN DEATH. FOR IF THE SEED BE PLANTED,
   THE WATER WILL RAISE IT UP AGAIN. HERE IS THE SECRET OF THIS. THE
   WORD IS IN THE BRIDE (AS IT WAS IN MARY). THE BRIDE HAS THE MIND OF
   CHRIST FOR SHE KNOWS WHAT HE WANTS DONE WITH THE WORD. SHE
   PERFORMS THE COMMAND OF THE WORD IN HIS NAME FOR SHE HAS “THUS
   SAITH THE LORD.” THEN THE WORD IS QUICKENED BY THE SPIRIT AND IT
   COMES TO PASS. Like a seed that is planted and watered, it comes to full harvest, serving its
   purpose. Those in the bride do only His will. No one can make them do otherwise. They have
   “thus saith the Lord” or they keep still. They know that it has to be God in them doing the
   works, fulfilling His own Word. HE DID NOT COMPLETE ALL HIS WORK WHILE IN
   HIS EARTHLY MINISTRY SO NOW HE WORKS IN AND THROUGH THE BRIDE. She
   knows that, for it was not yet time for Him to do certain things that He must now do. But He
   will now fulfill through the bride that work which He left for this specific time.
    Now, what’s next? We find that in the Apostolic five-fold ministry in the New Testament it
   is typed out very wonderfully in Elijah and Elisha. If you’ll open your Bibles to the 2nd chapter
   of II Kings, 2nd chapter and about, oh, say, read about the 9th verse there:
   2 Kings 2:9-11-Scripture Reading:
   9 And it came to pass, when they were gone over,” (This is Elijah and Elisha going to the
   Jordan) “that Elijah said unto Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I be taken away from
   thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me.
   10 And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing: nevertheless, if thou see me when I am taken from
   thee, it shall be so unto thee; but if not, it shall not be so.
   11 And it came to pass, as they still went on,” (I’d like to emphasize they still went on) “and
   talked, that, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both
   asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.
    Here we have a type of the ministry of the Bride of Christ, to receive a double portion of the
   Spirit that was upon Elijah. Here is this first Elijah finishing up his last part of his ministry,
   going to the Jordan after he had challenged all the false prophets that he and he alone was God's
   true servant and that he alone was able to produce the Fire of God, which we know types out
   perfectly, today, the messenger of Revelation 10:7. Amen, and of Malachi 4.
    So, we have here now, we have the five-fold ministry walking along with the Elijah of this
   hour, typing back in that hour now. They’re going down to the Jordan. This ministry has seen
   the great power that God has given to a man that will stay with his word. And, down in his
   heart, he is burning for that Anointing to rest upon his ministry. He knows that God has called
   him. He has confidence that he has received a call from God.
    So, as they approached the Jordan, Elijah has a "speak the Word" Ministry, "Ask what you
   will and I’ll give it to yah." Amen. So, he turns to the one that he loves and he says, "What
   would you that I do for you?" And he said, "Sir, my heart is a burning for a double portion of
   that Spirit that is anointing you." "Well, you have asked a hard thing, but nevertheless, if you
   see me go, you can have what you ask for."
   The Last Day Ministry
   
   13
    Now, there was a stipulation there to the promise of the prophet, "If you see me go, you can
   have it." And that is typed out today, if you will obey the word of the Lord, through the prophet,
   you may have a double portion of God's spirit. If you’ll do what he tells you to do.
    But now, we’re living in the hour of investigating angels has come down to see whether or
   not you are going to obey the word of God. Every tape that you hear that, that word of that
   prophet comes through your ear and my ear and we continually to fail to line up to this word,
   we are forgetting the Promise that he has made to us. Can you say, Amen? Every message that
   he preached will judge you and I on Judgment Day if we fail to do it. Just saying, "Oh, I believe
   the message," is not enough. This message must be in you, and if it is in you, it must produce
   the fruit of Jesus Christ. Just saying, "I believe the message and I love the messenger and I go to
   every meeting, will not amount to nothing if we fail to do what God has told us to do by the
   messenger.

   64-0308 - The Token
   William Marrion Branham
   63 You’ve got to have the Token. And when the Token comes, It testifies of Christ. He said It
   would. And Christ is the Word. And how can you deny that the Bible is true, part of It, and still
   say you have the Token, when the Token is the testimony of Jesus Christ? See, there is what I
   wonder. 64 “Oh,” say, “I don’t believe, I believe the days of miracle…” Oh, look out, there is no
   Token there. The Token punctuates every Word with an “amen,” everything, ’cause it’s God
   Itself. See? All right. 65 But if the token was not there, the covenant was not in effect. It was
   annulled. Same now! No matter how—how much you say, how much you’d say, “I believe
   every Word in the Bible,” say, “Brother Branham, I—I can quote you half of that Bible, all
   the Bible, by heart. I believe every bit of It.” That’s good. Satan does, too. Uh-huh. It takes the
   Token! 66 “Well, Brother Branham, I’ve got my wall full of degrees. I’m a Bachelor of Art, and I
   have a doctor’s degree, and an LLD. of Latin. And, oh, I’ve wrote books. I’ve done this. I done
   everything. I’ve—I’ve done all these things.” I don’t care. That’s all all right, but yet you’ve got
   to have the Token. The Token, still the Token is required! 67 You say, “I’m a Bible student. I’m
   a—I’m a good person. I’m this, that.” That may be fine, that’s all good, but still it’s got to have
   the Token! 68 Now, death was ready to strike Egypt at any time, and so is death ready to strike
   the nation now at any time. 69 Anna Jeanne, I feel something like your dad, said a remark one
   time. I’ve always liked that. He said, “You know, this nation, with the same sins, if God lets
   America get by with what she is doing, He will be morally obligated to raise Sodom and
   Gomorrah up and apologize to them, for burning them.” And that’s right. 70 Remember, Israel
   paid for every sin she did, and so will we. How loosely are we getting? Tighten up the armor!
   Come back to God, church! Not saying these things to be different. I’m telling you as a warning.
   You believe! 71 Death was ready to strike. God had showed them His grace and His mercy,
   through powers and signs and wonders (so has He today before taking the Church out), still
   they desired not to repent and to believe the message. 72 See, there was a message just before
   the taking out of the church. There always has to be. Same now. Every spiritual happening is a
   sign from God. Do you believe that? [Congregation says, “Amen.”—Ed.] Like THE
   MESSAGE, THERE IS A SIGN AND THEN THE MESSAGE FOLLOWS THE SIGN. God
   told Moses, said, “If they won’t believe the voice of the first sign, maybe they’ll believe the voice
   The Last Day Ministry
   
   14
   of the second sign.” 73 Now, when you see signs going on, and no message behind it, just the
   same old school of theology and on down, that wasn’t from God. BUT WHERE THERE IS A
   SIGN SHOWED, A MESSAGE FOLLOWS IT. NOW LOOK. JESUS COME ON THE
   SCENE…

   must have the Token, the very Life that was in Christ be in you. “When I see That, I will pass
   over you.”
   
    And he said, "If you see me go, you may have this double portion." And the Scripture said,
   "And they walked on." And after you hear a message from this prophet, you go right on
   walking. And many of us fail to do what he says. Many of the women hear him say, "Don't cut
   your hair," and you go right on and cut your hair anyway and you say you believe the
   message. It proves you are not predestinated seed if you continue to do it. Amen.

   62-0127 - Meanest Man I Know
   William Marrion Branham
   And when God kisses us welcome into His Kingdom, we’re home. It’s all right. It’s all over
   then. We’ve been washed by the preparation that He prepared for us: His Blood, a sweet
   smelling savour, perfumed by the sanctification that drives the stink of the world off (Hallelujah.
   I feel kind of religious right now.), taking away the stink of the world, or the desires of the
   world. See, if the world’s still in us then there’s something wrong. No wonder we can’t have a
   real Pentecostal revival. No wonder there’s something missing. The guest hasn’t exactly
   entered right. You see, Jesus taught that one time about the robes, and He said, “This man was
   found there not prepared, and he was bound and cast in outer darkness.” So much could be
   said on it. 47 But that’s the way they did it. Then they were home, they felt like they were a
   brother. You can’t feel like you’re a brother when you still desire the world. You can’t
   associate yourself out here in things of the world of cheating, lying, stealing, you women
   bobbing off your hair and wearing shorts and everything, then still feel at home when the
   Word of God’s being preached. You’re supposed to be Pentecostal, supposed to be filled with
   the Holy Ghost. Someone hit at me not long ago, said, “Why don’t you leave them people
   alone?” Said, “People think you’re a prophet.” I said, “I’m no prophet.” Said, “Well, they
   think you are. Why don’t you teach them people, them Pentecostals, how to receive these
   things, how to get great spiritual blessings and enter into the Presence of God and see visions
   also. If you’d leave them alone…” I SAID, “HOW CAN I TEACH THEM ALGEBRA
   WHEN THEY WON’T EVEN LEARN THEIR ABC’S?” 48 HOW CAN THEY ACCEPT
   SPIRITUAL THINGS WHEN THEY WON’T EVEN HAVE THE COMMON DECENCY

   Unhonorable things that the Bible says that you shouldn’t do, yet we associate with it. Sure.
   See, you can’t be welcome. No, sir. You’re out of place with the Word, and He is the Word.
   Now, so much for that. We’ll get that some other time.
    And he said, "If you see me go." We type this out every time that we hear a message and we
   fail to do what the prophet says. He preached a message, "Get desperate Friends, something is
   getting ready to happen."

   100 You can’t be desperate till God speaks to you. Oh, Church, rise and shake yourself! Pinch
   your conscience, wake yourself up, in this hour! We must be desperate, or perish! There is
   coming forth something from the Lord! I know it as THUS SAITH THE LORD. There is
   coming forth something, and we better get desperate. It’s between Life and death. It’ll pass
   through us and we won’t see it.
    How many got desperate? He preached, "Don't stop praying day or night until you talk to
   Him." How many stopped praying day or night? Most of us forgot completely the messages that
   he preached. And the Bible said, "If you see me go, if you stay with this word, you can have it."
    This investigating time of the angels is here now to see whether or not you and I are going to
   line up to the word of God and press ourselves into it. There is a pressing that we must press
   with. Paul said that. Didn't he? There is an effort that we must put forth to make sure that the
   things that are in our heart are taken out by seeking God. I believe that there is a purging of our
   souls, to purge out these things that are not of God in our heart.
    Oh, and I think that we are so carnal minded in this hour. And to think that the revelation of
   the hour is coming forth and it said it should produce such stimulation among us that we could
   shout and praise God Oh my! And be so stimulated from what God is doing. And yet there is a
   deadness among our assemblies. We can hardly sing; we can hardly have the joy of the Lord that

   63-0320 - The Third Seal
   William Marrion Branham
   
   176 Now notice, now, and here we are at the end time. And spiritual Eve, just as nat-…as
   Hebrew Eve was promised, the Hebrew bride was promised the Word to return. And the
   spiritual bride from Pentecost, when she fell at Nicaea, then she is promised in the last days
   that the Word will come again. Now you say, then… 177 You want another Scripture, take over
   here, Revelation 10. And said, “In the hour, the time of the—THE LAST ANGEL, THE
   SEVENTH ANGEL (SEVENTH MESSENGER) BEGINS TO SOUND, THE MYSTERY OF
   GOD IS FINISHED.” SEE? THE RESTORATION BACK TO THE WORD! The Bible said
   The Last Day Ministry
   
   16
   that this messenger of the last days would be, “Restore them back to the original Faith again,
   back to the Faith of the fathers.” BUT DO YOU THINK THEY RECEIVE IT? NO, SIR.
   “Last days, He would restore the original Word again,” as He said in Malachi 4. 178 But she
   had forfeited. Now, she had forfeit that Word at Nicaea. Eve forfeited in Eden; Eve rejected hers
   at Calvary. And Nicaea’s group is rejecting It in the last days, just the same. My! 179 But when
   the Word came in human flesh, she, Eve, the Hebrew church, mother of all spiritual living at
   then, SHE REJECTED IT. SHE WAS SO DEAD, IN HER TRADITIONS AND DOGMAS,
   THAT SHE MISSED IT. So is this one, exactly. All right. 180 THEY MISS HIM, THE
   LIVING WORD MANIFESTED IN THE FLESH, BY THE WORD THAT IS PROMISED.
   The Word promised to do these things. The promise was made, that it’ll be like this in the last
   days. “As it was in the days of Sodom, so shall it be in the Coming of the Son of man.” Now
   watch what happened at Sodom. “As it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be in the coming of
   the Son of man.” See? Watch what happened then. See? Now, He said it would be the same
   thing, and we live in that day. Well, and it could be, I guess, I could get six hundred promises of
   them like that, out of the Scripture, just referring to it. See? Now, but, they reject It. 181 She
   held to traditions and substitute, instead of the—the… She held to the substitute blood, instead
   of the real Blood. Jesus, the Word, said, when It was manifested to her, “Because she held to
   these traditions…” Jesus, the manifested Word, said to the bride, Hebrew bride, “Because you
   hold to your traditions, YOU MAKE THE WORD OF GOD WITHOUT ANY EFFECT TO
   YOU. IT CAN’T BE EFFECTIVE.” 182 NOW THAT’S WHAT’S THE REASON TODAY,
   THAT, THE—THE REVIVALS THAT WE’RE SUPPOSED TO HAVE, WE HAVE
   DENOMINATIONAL REVIVALS. WE HAVEN’T HAD A REAL STIRRING. NO, NO, NO.
   NO, SIR. DON’T THINK WE GOT REVIVALS. We haven’t. Oh, they’ve got millions and
   millions and millions of church members, BUT NOT A REVIVAL NOWHERE. NO. NO. 183
   THE—THE BRIDE HASN’T HAD A REVIVAL YET. See? THERE’S BEEN NO REVIVAL
   THERE, NO MANIFESTATION OF GOD TO STIR THE BRIDE YET. SEE? WE’RE
   LOOKING FOR IT NOW. IT’LL TAKE THOSE SEVEN UNKNOWN THUNDERS BACK
   THERE, TO WAKE HER UP AGAIN, SEE. YEAH. HE’LL SEND IT. HE PROMISED IT.
   Now watch. 184 Now, she was—she was dead. And now if the churches would forget their
   creeds, and forget their dogmas, and just take the Bible, plead the promise, then it would come
   effective to them. But, see, Jesus said, “You, with your traditions, make the Word of God not
   effective to you.” Well, that’s the same thing today with spiritual Eve, see, the spiritual bride of
   today, so-called, the church. She takes the Word of God, and she won’t accept It. And she
   accepts dogmas, instead. Therefore, the Word is not effective to her, see, because she tries to
   inject her creed with the Word, and it won’t work. Now, what we need today… 185 I just keep
   reading this here, Herald of His Coming, across the headlines, “WE NEED A PROPHET TO
   RETURN! WE NEED A PROPHET TO RETURN!” AND I GUESS, WHEN HE DOES
   RETURN, THEY’LL KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT. Just…That’s right. It’s always been that
   way, you see. “We need it,” everything you talk about, “WE NEED A PROPHET TO
   RETURN, WHO WILL BRING THE WORD OF THE LORD, FEARLESS. WE BELIEVE
   THE BIBLE PROMISED IT.”
    And yet we say, "How many has got the Baptism?" And everybody raises their hands. And
   many say, "If you believe the message, you surely got it." But I tell you, tonight, THAT WE
   NEED A BORN-AGAIN EXPERIENCE OF THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST. That’s
   The Last Day Ministry
   
   17
   what we need. We need... Those that do have the Baptism of the Holy Ghost, WE NEED

   hates sin. And how is God, the Holy Spirit, going to live in a person that’s always committing
   sins, going out deliberately, doing this and that, running to these kind of places. That’s what’s
   the matter with the church. You say, “Well, Brother Branham, I spoke in tongues.” I don’t
   care what you done. If your life don’t type up with God’s Bible… I’ve seen witches and
   wizards speak in tongues. I’ve seen them dance in the spirit and everything else. America’s
   rotten with that tommyrot. I believe in speaking in tongues. I believe in every gift the Bible said
   in here. I believe it. But it’s got to be put in its right place and carried on at the right way, at the
   right time. And God will vindicate every bit of it to be the truth. Right. 58 And now, I don’t mean
   to be rude. I don’t mean that. I just don’t mean for to hurt you, my friends. But I mean to be
   honest with you. Yes, sir. 59 Someone, years ago when I first started preaching, they said, “Billy,
   you preach that and your church will be tore up.” I said, “Any church that’s tore up by old
   fashioned gospel preaching ought to be tore up.” THAT’S RIGHT. THAT’S EXACTLY
   RIGHT. I SAID, “I’D PREACH IT IF I HAVE TO LAY ON MY STOMACH AND DRINK
   BRANCH WATER AND EAT SODA CRACKERS EVERY DAY OF MY LIFE AND
   PREACH TO A FOUR PILLAR POST IN THE CHURCH.” I’D RATHER DO IT AND
   TELL THE TRUTH AND HAVE FAVOR WITH GOD THAN PREACH TO TEN
   THOUSAND PEOPLE AND EAT FRIED CHICKEN THREE TIMES A DAY. YES, SIR. TO
   BE HONEST WITH GOD…
    I tell you, what’s the matter with us today, is that we’re not in love with Jesus. If we was in
   love with Him, we would have the kind of a prayer life that we need. If we were in love with
   him, the women wouldn't wear the kind of a clothes that they’re wearing, today. If we were in
   The Last Day Ministry

   love with him, the men, we would put our wives into subjection by love. If we were in love with
   him, we’d be doing the things that God requires of us in this hour. And one thing he requires is
   that you love one another. Amen.
    I know that the greatest thing that we can do is to obey the word of God but, I tell you, the
   first thing that you have got to have is an experimental experience with the Lord Jesus
   Christ. You have got to come in contact with Jesus Christ and be born again of His Spirit. Or,
   you can sit and listen to the message and you can finally, if you’re associated with the right
   people, you can learn this message inside and out and it won't amount to a hill of beans, if
   you’re not filled with the Holy Ghost. Can you say, Amen? (Amen)

   63-0119 - The Way Of A True Prophet
   William Marrion Branham
   209 How you going to build your church upon the Rock? How will the preacher ever stand in the
   pulpit and preach the Rock, and build it upon the fundamentals of the full Gospel, when his
   audience, some of his people out there, would put him out? Now, I blame the preacher for not
   having the audacity, and the Spirit of God, for just shutting the door, say, “Get somebody else
   will stand for that stuff and not me.” I—I admire a preacher that would do that. 210 But woe
   unto that congregation when an anointed man of God tries to bring them the Word, and then
   they won’t line up with It. That’s right. How is he going to have a church that all the nine gifts
   operating in it, and so forth, and then, they and that, and the church won’t even—even live
   decently and morally, won’t learn their ABC’s of the Gospel? Then say, “If I had a better
   preacher!” Why, it’s your fault. That’s right.
   
    WE NEED THE ANOINTED PRESENCE OF JESUS CHRIST IN OUR
   ASSEMBLIES. WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO COME OUT OF THIS WORLD THAT IS SO
   WICKED OUT HERE AND COME INTO OUR ASSEMBLY AND FEEL THE PRESENCE
   OF JESUS CHRIST IN OUR MIDST. IT’S NOT ENOUGH JUST TO SING A FEW SONGS
   AND PREACH THE WORD OF GOD. WE NEED TO HAVE THE HOLY GHOST IN OUR
   MIDST. WE NEED TO FEEL THE ANOINTING BEHIND THE PULPIT.
    I think one of the greatest things that an assembly can do in this hour, is to set their church in
   divine order where, when you come through that door, that not a person will say a word. But
   you will come to your seat and sit down and begin to pray and meditate upon God.
    How can you feel the Presence of Jesus Christ when you come in your church and keep on
   talking, the way you do here? You forgive me for saying that but I only say what God puts on
   my heart. How can you expect to have the Anointing of the Holy Ghost in your midst when you
   talk the way you do? You don't believe he’s in here, really, when you do that. We need to set
   our assemblies in order. And if we’ll do these little things, let me tell you...
    I challenge this church here tonight, if you’ll set this church here in divine order, as the
   prophet has said, you will begin to feel the anointed Presence of Jesus Christ. And the ministers
   will find that Anointing behind the pulpit, that they have henceforth never known before. And
   you’ll find...

    Let me tell you something, you can preach the word of God all you want to. You could
   preach the word of God in this message from Genesis to Revelation. But, if you don't have the
   anointed Presence of Jesus Christ in this Assembly, it’ll never convict you of your sins. IT
   TAKES THE WORD OF GOD AND THE POWER OF THE HOLY GHOST TO CONVICT A
   MAN OF SIN, AND A WOMAN.

   60-0402 - Believest Thou This?
   William Marrion Branham
   77 What we need is not education. We need the power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost
   back in the church to demonstrate the power. Jesus never said, “Go into all the world and—
   and teach.” He never said, “Go into all the world and do…” He said, “Go into all the world and
   preach the Gospel.” And the Gospel is to demonstrate the power of the Holy Ghost, the
   resurrection. We’re still a million miles short than where we should be. Let us move forward.
   Let’s go back where we left Him at the feast of Pentecost. 78 Jesus said, in John, I believe, the
   15th chapter, He said, “I am the Vine; ye are the branches.” Well now, if that Vine put forth the
   first branch, and out of that branch wrote a Book of Acts, the second branch will make another
   Book of Acts. The third branch will make another Book of Acts. And every branch that comes out
   of that Vine will be the same as the first branch was. 79 Now, you can graft, we know that. I’ve
   seen a citrus tree with about eight different kinds of fruit on it. I’ve seen a orange tree putting
   grapefruits, and lemons, and everything else on it, but they were drafted in. 80 That’s what’s the
   matter today. We’ve drafted in our ideas, drafted in our denominations, but if that tree ever puts
   forth another fruit vine, itself, it’ll be like the original ones that went into it. Hallelujah! Oh,
   church will blend together, but we need the power of the original. We need the Holy Ghost, the
   power of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. That’s what He told us to do. 81 “I am the Vine, ye
   are the branches.” If a grapevine puts forth a shoot, and it comes out with pretty blue grapes, the
   next vine it brings out will have pretty blue grapes on it. If the first Vine come out, and they fell
   under the impact of the Holy Spirit, and they did great miracles, and signs, and sealed their
   testimony to a world…Even many of them with their own testimony, they, with their blood, they
   sealed their testimony. They went through all kinds of perils and everything to bring the Gospel.
   They suffered; they were beaten; they were punished. “Must we be carried home to Heaven, on a
   flowery bed of ease, while others fought to win the prize, and sailed through bloody seas?” What
   do we expect to do? “I must fight if I must reign. Increase my courage, Lord.” Certainly. We
   need a… 82 We don’t need a new denomination. We don’t need a new church building. What
   we need today is an old-time backwoods, sky-blue, sin-killing Pentecostal revival, that was
   borned at Pentecost and is back into the church again, the power of the Holy Ghost again, to
   bring Jesus on the scene. 83 The God of history always rises on the scene in a crucial moment.
   We need it. That’s what’s the matter with our church today. We’re getting too far back. We’re
   falling into the fashions of the world. And gradually, year by year, it begins to die a little and
   wither away. 84 It’s pruning time pretty soon. God will cut it back as sure as I’m standing in
   this pulpit. God will cut her back to make her bear fruit. He will cut the works of the world out
   of it one of these days. SUCH A DISGRACE, THE WAY THE CHURCH HAS CARRIED ON
   UNDER THE NAME OF RELIGION. 85 AND WE FIND OUT, WHEN JESUS LEFT,
   DEATH SET IN. WHEN JESUS LEAVES OUR CHURCH, THE POWER OF THE HOLY
   SPIRIT LEAVES OUR CHURCH, IT BEGINS TO DWINDLE AND—AND DIE. AND
   The Last Day Ministry
   
   20
   AFTER WHILE THERE’S NOTHING NO MORE TO IT. NOW, WHEN JESUS LEFT,
   DEATH SET IN. OH, WHAT A SAD TIME IT WAS. 86 And notice, they wondered around,
   and they sent for Jesus, but He didn’t come. They sent for Him again, and He didn’t come, but
   He knowed what He was going to do. He knows tonight, what He’s going to do. It’s not lost with
   Him: HE KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT HE’S FIXING TO DO. HE’S GOING TO RAISE A
   PEOPLE UP, JUST AS CERTAIN AS I’M STANDING IN THIS PULPIT. HE WILL RAISE
   A PEOPLE FOR HIS NAME’S SAKE OUT OF THE GENTILE GENERATION. HE WILL
   DO IT. 87 It’s the Jews’ time’s right at hand now, and of the Gentiles are ending out, because
   they just went on out. They’re rejecting Christ; they’re rejecting their signs; they’re rejecting
   everything that’s called godly, and brand it as some kind of telepathy or devil power and
   do…They’re blaspheming the Holy Ghost and sealing themselves away from God. And GOD
   WILL TAKE THAT MINORITY, AFTER WHILE, AND RAISE IT UP INTO A POWERFUL
   CHURCH, AND THEN TURN THE SPIRIT TO THE JEWS, AND TAKE THE GENTILE
   CHURCH HOME. EXACTLY RIGHT. SHE’S IN THE MAKING NOW. Well, we’re at the
   end time, nearly.
    My God, I tell you today, it’s hard to find tears running down our eyes, today, when we
   know that the world is getting ready to burn up and that the people are going to perish by the
   millions. It’s hard to look around you and see your assembly bawling and crying with a
   burden. There’s a hardness that’s come upon our heart in this last hour that’s never been
   hitherto known before. How we need for the Baptism of the Holy Ghost to strike us here tonight
   and carve away these things from our heart, that we might see our Luke warmness and our
   deadness, to see our carnality as it really is.

   59-0628M - A Deceived Church, By The World
   William Marrion Branham
   76 “Samson, the Philistines is on thee.” Branham Tabernacle, worldly-ism is creeping in
   among you. What about it? Have you exposed your secret? Have you exposed that secret that
   God give you when you were wallowing there in the sawdust a few years ago? Have you let it
   creep out with social, formal worship? What’s happened to you? God can come down and
   perform a miracle and go right down through the audience and tell people the secrets of their
   hearts, and everything, and heal the sick and afflicted, and do signs and wonders, and preach
   His Word as hard as they can, by the Holy Ghost; and people say, “Well, I guess that’s all right.
   We enjoy listening to it once in a while, if we’re not too tired.” That’s Branham Tabernacle.
   The Philistines is on thee. 77 When, used to be when the preaching of the Word, and the old
   saints with the tears in their eyes, would rise to their feet and walk, sobbing, maybe not saying
   a word, just walking around, two or three times, and set down, so filled with the Holy Ghost!
   The Word fed them! “Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every Word that proceedeth
   out of the mouth of God.” Philistines is on thee, Branham Tabernacle. Philistines is on you,
   Pentecostal. 78 Course, the Philistines got you, rest of you, long time ago when you organized
   yourself so tight, nothing could come in ’less you was a Presbyterian, Baptist, Methodist,
   Catholic, or something. You wouldn’t have nothing to do with the rest of them. 79 So, revival in
   our day? How can we have it when the regular revival-giver is bound by the world? God won’t

   come in where the world is, you can just depend on that. You associate with the world, then
   it’s—it’s all of it. When you let the world creep in, you go to acting like the world, then you are
   finished. But when you’ll cut loose every fetter from the world, and come to God, God will use
   you until you go to flirting again. 80 Here’s the only hope that I have this morning, to wind up
   my Message, is this, “While Samson was bound, a new shock of hair growed out.” 81 GOD
   SEND US ANOTHER CHURCH JUST BEFORE THE END TIME, THAT THE POWER
   OF THE HOLY GHOST CAN COME INTO HER, IN THE DEMONSTRATIONS OF THE
   SPIRIT, AND MARK 16 CAN FOLLOW THE CHURCH, ACTS 2:4, ACTS 2:38, ALL OF IT
   WILL BE FOLLOWING RIGHT ALONG WITH THE CHURCH. SIGNS AND WONDERS
   ACCOMPANY THE APOSTLES. GREAT SIGNS OF HIS RESURRECTION ACCOMPANY
   THEM. WHILE WE’RE IN PRISON, SURELY GOD’S GROWING A CROP
   SOMEWHERE, FOR THE LAST GREAT KILL. May it be you, my Christian friend here this
   morning, may it be your strength has begin to grow. I pray that this Message this morning, and
   out into the land to where this will go, I trust that this Message will help bring the vitamin to
   your system that’ll grow a spiritual Power back into your life again.
    I tell you; we don't know what it is to fellowship with Jesus Christ. We don't know what it is,
   hardly in this hour to feel his great powerful Presence that searches you like a light coming into
   a room. You know, you can have a lot of dust and particles in your room but you can't hardly
   see them until the sunlight comes in. Then all of the particles and all the dirt shows up. Amen.
    And you’d be surprised what we are doing, that is displeasing the Holy Spirit, that’s driving
   Him away from us. And how can we expect to have the Lord Jesus Christ’s anointing our
   assembly. I tell you; our children need to come to service and feel the presence of God that
   they’ll know that he’s among us and begin to get close to the Lord. Just talking won't convict
   your children, Friend. They need to feel the Holy Ghost rest upon them.
    How it thrills my heart when I bring to my remembrance, when my little girl, how we used
   to seek the Lord. We don't do it enough anymore, yet that we have devotions in our home, twice
   a day we try to. And I see to the point that I whip my children and then I pray with them too.
    How many homes you go into where you have never seen the father and mother down on
   their knees, praying with their children? You’ve got to get those children exposed to the Holy
   Spirit to convict them of their sins. No wonder we are having so much trouble with our children
   in this hour. Can you say, Amen? We need to expose ourselves to the presence of Jesus
   Christ. We need a burden.
    I tell you, this church in Beaumont, Texas, needs a burden for Beaumont, Texas. It’s hardly
   known among us, any person that has a travailing prayer life and a burden. But if we had the
   Baptism of the Holy Ghost, like we think we have it, it ought to give us a burden for this city
   and for our Brothers and Sisters and for this lost and dying world.
    I enjoy these messages on prayer marvelously. Yes, I do, but there is another side of it
   also. It is not good enough just to come into the presence of God and say few words or many
   words, as far as that goes. But the greatest prayer that I know of, for any individual, is for the
   Holy Ghost to take you and begin to pray and travail and agonize as the Spirit maketh
   intercession according to His own will, for you don't even know what you are praying for. Can
   you say, Amen? When you begin to have a prayer life that doubles you up inside and you begin
   The Last Day Ministry
   
   22
   to travail and agonize for somebody that is in need, then you’ll know what the baptism of the
   Holy Ghost will do for you.
    But it is hard to be found in this hour. Where can you find anybody so burdened that they’re
   off in a room crying and praying somewhere? Amen. Oh, we say, "Well, we are living in a
   Laodicean hour." That is not supposed to be, though, with us. You can have the baptism of the
   Holy Ghost, you can have that close walk with the Lord, when you will pay the price for it. But,
   if we continually walk after the flesh, we’re going to just die more spiritually. We need to
   mortify these deeds of the body and begin to seek after spiritual things. We need to think
   spiritual and talk spiritual and act spiritual. Amen.
    There is a need I find, throughout the assemblies where I go, for the women... How many
   women in this hour, they want to do everything else but what God wants them to do. They want
   everything else but a meek and a quiet spirit. They want everything else but to find a prayer
   closet and get into it and find a prayer ministry.
    I tell you, one of the greatest ministries that ever was and ever will be is for that saint to find
   a place to kneel and pray, where God can give him a burden. You say, "I don't have a burden to
   pray." God gives a burden, a travailing burden, to those that go and wait on it and want
   it. Amen, he gives it. But just as soon...
   You let two or three persons get that kind of a prayer life, you watch something begin to take
   place in your assembly. You just set this church in divine order where you begin to pray before
   service.
    We come to service so nonchalant today, it’s pitiful. I think it’s a disgrace to the Holy
   Ghost. We don't have the sincerity that we need in this hour. It takes a lot of sincerity in this
   hour to get any place with God. Can you say, Amen?
    Oh, isn't it wonderful, though, to come together that where you are so... I tell yeah, there is a
   church in this land that’s so stirred that they can't wait to get to the assembly. And I say with
   reverence and respect, that it is the only assembly that I ever walked in, in the United States of
   America, where as a minister, you walk into a church that is set in order with no one talking
   whatsoever. Everybody in prayer and been in prayer before they got to service and as soon as
   you come in you feel the anointed presence of Jesus Christ.
    The first time I walked into it after it was set in order, the spirit was so strong on me I could
   hardly get to the pulpit. And just tore me up so bad I didn't know what to do. And then I
   remembered the words of the prophet in a message that he said, "I long to walk into an
   assembly that is set in order. Where the people are praying, and meditating upon God. And you
   come in behind the pulpit and the Spirit strikes you and anoints you to preach the word."

   26 And that’s what’s the matter with the church today, the reason that we don’t have great
   mighty manifestations. This great church of the living God in these last days should be far
   down the road with every Divine gift set in order, a great, beautiful church. But we have broke
   up into denominations, and isms, and little fusses, and everything, till God can do no more with
   us, until we come together and get our hearts right with God. That’s why our blessings are about
   run out. That’s why in the churches it’s getting cold and cooling off, is because we’ve been
   The Last Day Ministry
   
   23
   indifferent towards God, His Spirit, and His Word. It’s true. We never welcome the Holy Spirit
   no more.
    But, when you walk into an assembly that’s been talking all day long, that has never knelt
   and prayed, that is been doing all the things of the flesh all day long and you come in, what have
   you got? No anointing, no presence of Christ, no tears in nobody's eyes, nobody burdened. No
   matter how much doctrine you preach, we still got to have the little things. Can you say,
   Amen? The little things is what count in this hour. He said, "Do these things and God has
   something greater for you."
    We find that in this hour, God has sent this restoration prophet to restore a true five-fold
   ministry. This is typed out also. And you notice, here, that this five-fold ministry, the Bride, got
   the double portion because this ministry was not fooled by what this prophet said. This ministry
   went walking right along with that prophet though they walked on for a space of time. They
   never did forget the words that that prophet said, "If you see me go, you can have what I ask
   for."
    And God tried that ministry by sending a chariot down out of heaven with a flaming Fire
   around it. Most of us, today, would have forgot all about that and looked to that great
   manifestation. But not that man, he kept his eyes glued on that prophet because, when they was
   walking along, he said, "If I will stay with this word, if I stay with this word, God will give me a
   double portion of what he’s got on his servant." And he kept his eyes on that prophet and he
   knew that he had the double portion, friend, cause he knew he did what God told him to do
   through the prophet.
    And when the chariot reached down and got the prophet and took him away, he had perfect
   confidence that he had obeyed God and went over and struck the Jordan and said, "Where is the
   Lord God of Elijah?" And I believe that, in this hour, there is some men somewhere that is
   going to stay with this message and when... If the time ever comes, and I believe it will that the
   messenger will be taken from them, that they will strike the waters also and say, “Where is the
   Lord God of Elijah?"
    Can you imagine what was in the hearts of the fifty other sons of the prophets, standing by
   the river? Amen.
    God types this out also over in a couple chapters back where Elijah had, in his last phase of
   his ministry, had just challenged the false prophets and cut their heads off. That’s right at hand
   now, when there is coming a Mount Carmel showdown in this latter rain, where this messenger
   would challenge all the preachers of the world to produce the Fire of God. "Let the God that be
   God answer by Fire." It’s coming again, amen.

   what it would be tonight, if we could climb above the heavens of heaven and look at this great

   drama as it’s getting set together now, fixing to come to pass, of God and the devil coming to a
   showdown. I’m so glad that I’m on the winning side. I’m so glad that I follow the Lamb.
   Because it said, “The Lamb overcame them, for He was King of kings and Lord of lords.” The
   time has come now for you to make a decision tonight, what side you’ll be on. AND I TRUST
   GOD THAT YOU’LL MAKE THE DECISION THAT YOU’LL FOLLOW THE LAMB.
    And then, after that, he asked his servant to go up on the mountain and see whether or not he
   could see a cloud. And he told him, said, "Go seven times." Which proves that, in the Seventh
   Church Age, God would send forth another Elijah that will look toward the sea for a ministry to
   rise that will preach the same thing that he has brought.
    God has sent this messenger to produce a ministry and a Bride just like the one on the Day of
   Pentecost and greater. Can you say, "Amen?" Man has not been able to do this but God,
   through a prophet, through a message, has turned our hearts back again to the true message that
   the apostles had that came on the Day of Pentecost, amen.

    When the messenger of Elijah went to the mountain the seventh time, in the Seventh Church

   man's hand," apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors and teachers. And it said, “But it’s rising
   up out of the sea." And, out of the sea of all these churches, God has brought out a people and is
   raising up a ministry just like the one on the Day of Pentecost.
    We find that the ministry of the Bride of Christ, in Ephesians 4, is to bring the Bride to
   perfection. God did not say that he would bring the Bride to perfection through tapes, did he? A
   lot of people say, "Well I don't have to listen to any minister besides Brother Branham, because
   that which is perfect is come now, and we have the tapes." God didn't say that. He said, that he
   gave a five-fold ministry for the perfecting of the saints.

   14 Now, on the platform, when the Holy Spirit’s a speaking, and He’s speaking through

   preached a sermon in your life: the Holy Spirit preached through you a sermon. That’s right.
   See? See that? See? We don’t preach. The Holy Spirit does the speaking. Oh, we might write
   out something and read it, but that—that isn’t preaching. Preaching is when inspiration comes
   and (See?)—and it’s preached by inspiration and the Holy Spirit gives the unction. Now, we
   can read something, and it just doesn’t matter, but when the Holy Spirit gets a hold of it and
   takes it out to the people, then something takes a hold. See? And that’s the Holy Spirit. That’s
   not your pastor preaching; that’s the Holy Spirit preaching in your pastor out to you, giving

   saying. Another man interprets under inspiration, and directs the message straight to someone
   and tells them where their trouble, what’s happened, and—and different things to do. That’s all
   inspiration. It’s the Holy Spirit. Then He—He sends those gifts into the church. Pastor,
   preacher, teaching, apostles, prophets, and all those things are gifts of God, that goes together
   for the perfecting of the church, or the saints then. It all is one big unit of God. No matter
   whether we belong to this church or that church or that church, as long as we’re borned of the
   Spirit of God, we’re sons and daughters of God. Isn’t that wonderful? Wouldn’t it be nice
   tonight, if all Christians could see that? Wouldn’t that—wouldn’t we have a revival?

   56-1207 - Gifts
   William Marrion Branham
   28 Now, we have the Spirit by these gifts, by portions. BUT CHRIST HAD IT WITHOUT
   MEASURE. We have It by measure. To one is given knowledge, to another one is given wisdom.
   There are in the church five offices: Apostles or missionaries, either one, both the same thing,
   word means “one sent.” And apostles, prophets, teachers, evangelists, and pastors, God sets
   them in the church. But because one would be an apostle, the prophet couldn’t say, “You’re not
   in it.” Or the pastor to the evangelist or so forth. But they’re all little lines of God that’s put into
   the church for the perfecting of the saints. And in every local body is twelve spirit—nine spiritual
   gifts, in First Corinthians 12, nine spiritual gifts in—in each body. They oper—operate
   separately, but of the same-self Spirit. Now… But in Christ was the fulness. Now, if you see a
   man here prophesying, and another a pastor, one evangelist and another a teacher. Now, you
   can’t say you’re not in it, because it’s just one of them rays off of God. It all points right back
   to God, that big master diamond. Don’t forget that.
   
    There’re things that Brother Branham cannot do because God will not let him do it. Brother
   Branham cannot take the place of God's predestinated, God called, elected, chosen, anointed
   five-fold ministry. To reject one of these offices, when they are set in divine order, is to reject
   just as much the prophet of God. Amen. You don't believe that, maybe. The Bible said that,
   Amen. To despise not dignities.
    God, in this hour, is preparing this ministry, now. They are called and they know they are
   called. Many of them know exactly what God has told them to do and they’re only
   waiting. Many, in this hour, think they are called and they’re not called. We have evangelists
   pastoring and pastor doing evangelist work, when the Bible said, "Let every man abide in the
   calling wherein he is called."
   1 Corinthians 7:20-Reference quote:
   20 Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called.
    I don't pastor because I am not a pastor. But yet I could pastor, in training, but I would rather
   wait for what God has called me for. Cause the prophet said, "Ephraim cannot eat corn in
   Manasseh's corner." A pastor can never profit as an evangelist. But yet, he can do that, though it
   is not his calling. He’ll prosper more in what God has called him for.
    So, we see here that there could not have been a five-fold ministry, in this Age that we are
   living in or the Age before it, because we did not have the truth. First, you must have restoration
   word. God never sends anybody until first he trains them and he sends them with the truth. Can
   you imagine God sending a man without the truth and anointing an error? We may speak an
   error in ignorance but, God, if we are called, he will lead us to the truth. Amen?
    So, here we have Elijah, his servant, typing out the very thing in this hour. And, as I
   understand, that Brother Branham has just seen a hand out in the wilderness. Brother Branham
   knows what is going on, though many of us may not. He knows that there has to come a
   The Last Day Ministry
   
   27
   ministry on the scene, though he may not say anything about it. But he did say we are living in
   the Ephesian Church. And the Ephesian Church is the perfect Church that God has resurrected
   in this hour with a five-fold ministry and the gifts of the Spirit in operation. And yet many of us
   that are believers in this message are saying that that has been done away with.

   William Marrion Branham
   211 I laid my hands against the rock and looked up towards Heaven and started praying. I heard
   a Voice coming out of the top of the rocks there, said, “What are you leaning against, over your
   heart?” And I raised back like this, my bare shoulders; naked from my waist up, hot. I looked
   back. And there was wrote in the quartz, in the stone, “White Eagle”; JUST EXACTLY WHAT
   THE VISION SAID THAT THE NEXT MESSAGE WOULD COME FORTH BY. 212 I was
   so excited, I run home; got a camera and come back the next day, and took the picture of it. It
   was still there, wrote in the rock: “White.” (Dove leading eagle.)

   71 What this is for is to get the elected people that’s coming out, like in the days of Noah. Like in
   the days of—of Elijah, the seven thousand or seven hundred, or whatever it was, that hadn’t
   bowed their knee, to call them out. JOHN CALLING OUT THE ELECTED, AND GIVE IT
   OVER TO CHRIST WHEN HE COME, SWAPPED HIS CHURCH, SAID, “I MUST
   DECREASE, HE MUST INCREASE, BECAUSE,” HE SAID, “I’M JUST A VOICE OF
   HIM, CRYING IN THE WILDERNESS, ‘PREPARE THE WAY FOR THE LORD.’” AND
   JESUS COME THE SAME WAY. Gets the elected ready to hear the voice of God, that’s what
   the prophetic sign is. Oh, if you follow these Messages, get the per-…get the elected ready. Not

   William Marrion Branham
   79 And I believe we’re on the border land tonight. I was wondering about all my meetings and
   things, how I had to cancel them out. I truly believe, before the Church can have the Rapture,
   it’s got to have rapturing faith. WE CAN’T EVEN HAVE FAITH FOR DIVINE HEALING,
   LET ALONE RAPTURING FAITH. GOT TO HAVE A FAITH THAT’LL CHANGE AND
   QUICKEN THIS BODY, AND BE TAKEN AWAY. I BELIEVE THERE’S A CHURCH ON
   ITS ROAD TONIGHT, A POWER OF THE LIVING GOD, THAT MEN WILL SPEAK THE
   WORD HERE AND THERE, AND IT’LL FLASH LIKE LIGHTNING. And a Church is
   coming out; not a psychologist, not some of this put-on, make-belief; BUT A REAL, TRUE,
   GENUINE, ANOINTED, HOLY GHOST, called-out Church! Amen.
    So, we have here a very type of the five-fold ministry which is to bring the saints of God into
   perfection according to Ephesians 4, that they would bring us into the unity of the faith.
   Ephesians 4:13-Reference quote:
   13 Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a
   perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:
    Can you imagine now the disunity among us? Imagine the disunity today and how it must
   bleed the heart of our savior, Jesus Christ. I think this, Brother Perry, is one of the most horrible
   things that ever was, just to see disunity among the Bride, the purchased Blood-bought Bride of
   Christ. Can you say, Amen? I tell you, oh, how we need the love of God in our hearts for one
   another.

   two or three hours, and I—I know He wants me to say this. And—and dear Christians, as long
   as you do that, and ministers, you’re going to stay in the kindergarten where you’re at right
   now, and you’ll never know no more than fuss and fight with one another. That’s all. Until
   you get big enough to walk out there and shake hands with your brother and have fellowship,
   God will bring you up and restore all the gifts back to the Church, and take the Church home.
   That’s right. But until you get big enough to get out of that traditional denominational barrier…
   Oh, it’s horrible. I tell you it is. It’s… Politics? You talk about our nation being on, just look at
   what disunity in our nation’s doing. Look what’s happened right now, right in the time of war.
   Isn’t that horrible? That’s a disgrace to our nation. WELL, IT’S MORE THAN A DISGRACE
   TO—TO JESUS CHRIST, THE CHURCH IN THE DISUNITY IT’S IN JUST BEFORE
   THE COMING OF THE LORD AND THE LOOSENING OF THE ANTICHRIST ON THE
   EARTH. And here we are, and separated with denominational barriers. “I’m a Methodist,
   praise God. You couldn’t shake me, I’m a Baptist. And I’m a—a Assembly of God. I’m a Church
   of God. I’m the United Pentecostal church.” And oh, my. What are any of you anyhow? That’s
   right. What’s any of us? Nothing, but what God would let us be. And it’s all in the grace of
   God. So let’s look to Him, praise Him, and associate with our brother. 21 IF THE
   BROTHER’S IN A ERROR, DON’T PUSH HIM DOWN. HE’S AS FAR AS HE WANTS TO
   BE NOW, FARTHER DOWN. HELP HIM UP. GIVE HIM A HAND. LIFT HIM UP. LOVE
   HIM. NO MATTER IF HE CAN’T AGREE WITH YOU, LOVE HIM ANYHOW. THAT’S
   RIGHT. AND JUST DON’T ACT LIKE IT; DO IT. PRAY THAT GOD GIVES YOU THAT
   KIND OF A HEART, AND THEN YOU WILL DO IT. THAT’S RIGHT. NOW, IT CAN BE
   DONE.
   
    Now, if you’ll notice here in another Scripture, over in... I would like to say this, too. That
   many are here have claimed to be God's called five-fold ministry. But over in II Peter, it says in
   II Peter 2:7, (II Peter 2:17) it said, "These ministers are wells without water, clouds..."
   2 Peter 2:17-18-Reference quote:
   17 These are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a tempest; to whom the mist of
   darkness is reserved for ever.
   18 For when they speak great swelling words of vanity, they allure through the lusts of the flesh,
   through much wantonness, those that were clean escaped from them who live in error.
   You notice it said, "clouds", didn't it? Like that man servant of Elijah saw back there, a cloud, a
   little cloud. And II Peter said, "These false prophets and teachers, they are like wells without
   water."
    And a ministry, that is not called of God and is not Holy Ghost filled and is not preaching the
   truth, is like a well without any water in it. You go there thinking you are getting water and you
   don't have any. Amen? Carried with a tempest, blown about by every wind of doctrine.
   Ephesians 4:14-15-Reference quote:
   4 That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind
   of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive;

   15 But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even
   Christ:
    And over in Jude 12, it said, "These false prophets and false teachers are spots in your feasts
   of charity."
   Jude 1:12-Reference quote:
   12 These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves
   without fear: clouds they are without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit withereth,
   without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;
    We know that Christ is coming after a Bride without spot, wrinkle or blemish. When I think
   that statement when we hear Christ is coming after a Bride without spot, wrinkle or blemish, I
   don't think of it is as a spot on her gown, but I think it is all these false make-believers. He’s not
   coming after them. Jude said he wasn't coming after these that feast right among us. He’s
   coming after his true Bride.
   Ephesians 5:26-27-Reference quote:
   26 That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word,
   27 That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any
   such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.
   
    Now, you notice, over here in Isaiah 4, we can see the ministry of Ephesians 4 in Isaiah 4,
   where it said, "In that day, seven women will take a hold of one man."
   Isaiah 4:1-Reference quote:
   1 And in that day seven women shall take hold of one man, saying, We will eat our own bread,
   and wear our own apparel: only let us be called by thy name, to take away our reproach.
    Seven churches, the fullness of the churches, will take a hold of the Pope and they will say,
   "Let us eat our own bread, let us preach our own doctrine and let us wear our own apparel, amen.
   Name Baptist, Methodist, Presbyterian; and let us eat our own bread, preach our own doctrine,
   only let us be called by thy name, World Council of Churches, to take away our reproach.
    Then," God said through Isaiah, "Then in that day shall the Branch of the Lord be beautiful
   for them that are escaped of Jerusalem." Amen? Then shall that Branch bring forth the fruit of
   Jesus Christ.
   Isaiah 4:2-Reference quote:
    In that day shall the branch of the Lord be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the earth
   shall be excellent and comely for them that are escaped of Israel.

   49 It’s tightening. And then when that time comes, and the press comes to a place to where
   you’re pressed out, then watch what I’m fixing to tell you in a few minutes. Watch the Third
   Pull then, see, and it’ll be absolutely to the total lost, but it—it will be for the Bride and the
   Church. 50 Now we are closer than it seems to be. I don’t know when, but it’s real, real close. I
   may be building a platform for somebody else to step on. I may be taken before that time. I don’t
   know. And that time may be this coming week, that the Holy Spirit will come with…and bring
   Christ Jesus. He may come this next week. He may come yet tonight. I don’t know when He will
   come. He doesn’t tell us that. 51 But I do believe, that we are so close, that I would never die
   with old age. Yet, at fifty-four years old, I’ll never die with old age, until He’s here. See? Unless
   I’m shot, killed, or something other, some way killed, just old age wouldn’t kill me, until He’s
   come. And I believe that. 52 And I want to say this. I’ve never said it before. But according to
   Scripture, according to what He said thirty years ago; thirty-three years ago on the river down
   there, in 1933, rather; what He said, everything has happened just exactly. I MAY NOT DO
   IT, BUT THIS MESSAGE WILL INTRODUCE JESUS CHRIST TO THE WORLD. FOR,
   “AS JOHN THE BAPTIST WAS SENT TO FORERUN THE FIRST COMING, SO IS THE
   MESSAGE TO FORERUN THE SECOND COMING.” AND JOHN SAID, “BEHOLD THE
   LAMB OF GOD THAT TAKES AWAY THE SIN OF THE WORLD.” SEE? SO, IT’S, IT
   PARALLELED IT IN EVERY WAY. AND I KNOW IT WILL, THE MESSAGE WILL GO
   ON.
    And that is when most of you will get filled with the Holy Ghost and not until. Many of us, it
   will take desperation and birth pains to bring forth the Holy Ghost birth.
    You’ve got to hunger and thirst. Just hungering is not enough. Amen? You can have a
   hunger for the Word of God and have no hunger at all for the Spirit. Did you know that? Jesus
   said, "Except you eat My flesh and drink my blood, you have no part of me." Many of us want
   to hear Word, Word, Word, but we don't want a thing about the Spirit the Holy Spirit. But he
   that hungereth after the Word and thirst after the Spirit, shall be filled.

   04 We have put too much stress on the Mechanics and nothing on the Dynamic. It needs the
   dynamic Power of God, the resurrection Power of Jesus Christ upon the Church, to manifest
   and to bring to pass that This is gasoline. It might be in a gasoline can; it could still be water,
   see. But the only proof of it, is, put this Life on it, and It’ll prove whether it’s gasoline or not. 105
   And when you try to put the Holy Spirit in a denomination, you are as much as trying…You can
   get a splutter; you’ll ruin your engine, by getting it full of carbon. 106 But, oh, I’m so glad that
   there is a ten thousand octane Power, the Word of God and a Holy Ghost to light It up, and to
   resurrect the Power of God into a man’s life, or a woman’s life, or into a church. That shoved
   that Cadillac down the road yonder, under the dynamic Power of the Holy Ghost which came
   back and was waved over the people at the Day of Pentecost, making Him the same yesterday,
   today, and forever. 107 There was the first Sheaf come up from all the prophets, which was
   the Son of God, the King of all prophets. 108 There has been churches, churches, brides, brides,
   churches, brides, brides. 109 But there has got to come One! Hallelujah! There has to come a
   real Bride! There must come One that’s not only got the Mechanics, but the Dynamics of It,
   makes that Church live, move in the Power of His resurrection. Until we come to that place,
   until we find that place, what good does it do to polish the hubs? What good does it do to give
   her a facelift or a simonize job, when there’s no Dynamics in it? No matter how much the
   Mechanics prove to be right, there has got to be a Dynamics to make It work. 110 That’s what
   He proved! Hallelujah! That’s what Easter proved. He wasn’t only the Word, but He was God
   Himself, the Dynamics, in the Word. That made the body of Jesus Christ (cold, stiff, and dead,
   in the grave) shake into Life and rise again, and roll away the stone. “I am He that was dead,”
   so dead till the sun said He was dead, the moon said He was dead, the stars said He was dead.
   All nature said He was dead. And now the whole world has to recognize that He’s alive again.
   He was not only the Mechanics, God’s Word, He was the Dynamics to prove It. 111 And as
   He, being the Groom, the Bride has to come forth, ’cause It’s part of Him. And It can only be
   the manifestation of the fulfilling of all the revelations any others has spoke of the Bride; It
   can only manifest. If it does something different from the Groom, it isn’t the Bride. Because,
   She is flesh of His flesh, bone of His bone; Life of His Life, Power of His Power! She is Him!
   As man and woman are one, and woman taken from his side; She had taken a Spirit, the feminish
   Spirit, from Him. The flesh from His side, made both Mechanics and Dynamics, the Wife. The
   Spirit of Him and the flesh of Him, and put it together, and made Mechanics and Dynamics.

   Until the church or the people… 112 All these Easter bunnies, and ceremonies, and big
   churches, and finery, will fail and pass away. 113 Until that Church becomes both Dynamics
   and Mechanics; and the Spirit of God, that moved Him, to do the things that He did! If He hit
   on sixteen cylinders, so will the Bride. Amen! For He said, in John 14:12, “He that believeth
   on Me, the works that I do shall he do also. I’ll give him a charge of My Dynamics, in his
   Mechanics, that the world will not be able to withstand it; and I’ll raise him up again at the
   last day.” That’s the Easter Message, the Dynamics and the Mechanics, together! The
   Mechanics without the Dynamics, no good; neither is the Dynamics, without the Mechanics. 114
   You can scream and shout, and jump up-and-down, all you want to, and deny this Word, it won’t
   do any good. You’re just cranking around the—the pistons of…Got the spark there to fire, but no
   gasoline to fire it by. 115 It’ll only work as they come together. Amen! So, one will set still, and
   the other One will go up. That’s the only thing there is to it. Yet, they both might look alike, both
   claim to be churches, both claim to be Bride. But One has Mechanics and Dynamics, It brings it
   to pass, of what He said is the Truth. 116 It just won’t move, no matter how good the Mechanics
   is, until the Dynamics come. When the Dynamics come, that Fire is made to connect with that
   octane in the gasoline. And when That explodes, it causes a combustion, and that combustion
   moves every motion, every move, for He is the same yesterday, today, and forever. That’s the
   resurrection. That’s the real Power of God, Mechanics with the Dynamics. Notice, “It’s the
   Spirit that quickens.” It’s the—it’s the Spark that fires. It’s not the gas that fires; it’s the
   Spark that fires the gas. See? 117 “You can do nothing without Me; but with Me you can do
   all things.” As He is the Word, It’s the Father living. “Father sent Me, so send I you. As the
   Father has fired Me and pushed Me into everything, I do only that which is pleasing to God.
   Now, as He sent Me, so send I you with the same Mechanics, and it takes the same Dynamics
   to operate It. And these signs shall follow them that claim to have the Mechanics. The
   Dynamics will take Its place.” 118 Paul said, “The Gospel came to us not in Word only,”
   through gasoline only, “but through Spark also,” to make It move. There you are. It came to us
   in that manner.
    And this will come, and come only, when the World Council of Churches begins to hound
   on your door, begin to press you into crying out to God. "O God, deliver Thy elected, Lord."
    God never did, He never did and he never will deliver you without a desperation first. There
   has to become a desperation, like the children down in Egypt. He never did take them out into
   the wilderness until they cried out from their taskmasters and then he sent them a
   deliverer. Amen?
    And the five-fold ministry... We’ll have to go on, the ministers now, that are called in the
   position that we’re in now, doing the best that we can. There is no five-fold ministry sent. I
   don't care what you may think about that but there is no five-fold ministry sent outside of
   Malachi 4.
    There are ministers called, but as I told a brother some time ago, I said... He challenged me
   on that thing. He said... I said, "Jesus was in the temple, wasn't He? And He was answering and
   both asking questions." But I said, "He wasn't sent yet. He went and was in subject to his
   parents. Then when he came to the River Jordan there came a Voice that said, 'This is My
   Beloved Son whom I am well pleased.' Then the Spirit anointed Him." Is, that right?

    And the five-fold ministry is called now and are doing the best that they can, leading you to
   the Truth and winning people to this message. But they are not sent, yet. And they will be,
   though, when this press comes. When this press comes, it will produce a ministry, a five-fold
   ministry, that is called and they will be placed in position by the Holy Ghost.
    This assembly, in that day, of Beaumont, Texas, this Local Christian Assembly, you will
   have, once again, the same kind of assembly that they had in Ephesians. You’ll have the gifts of
   the Spirit in operation. You’ll have every person in the place where God called them. Every
   member in the Body of Christ has a ministry.
    Aren't you concerned about it? Didn't you know that the Bible said, "Seek and covet
   earnestly good gifts."? How many are coveting a real gift from God today?
   1 Corinthians 12:31-Reference quote:
   31 But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way.
    Many of us may have a gift lying dormant in us and don't know it, because we are not concerned about it, maybe. We need to be earnest and sincere in what God has called us for. God
   has called you for a reason not just to take you to heaven. He wants to glorify himself through
   the least of you. Can you say, "Amen?"
    How many want to be used of the Lord Jesus Christ? It doesn't satisfy you to say, "Oh,
   Brother Perry Green is used of the Lord." What good is that going to do you? You say, "Oh,
   Brother Perry, I know he is in contact with the Holy Spirit." But how about you? Amen? Each
   one of us wants it and before we go in the rapture every one of us must have a experimental
   experience with Jesus Christ daily. Perfect fellowship with the Lord God. That’s oneness.
    Now we find that the five-fold ministry at the time of the seven women, the seven churches
   taking a hold of the Pope at this time, God, when the people begin to travail out in prayer, in
   agonizing prayer, crying out to God, the Holy Ghost will set some in order: apostles, prophets,
   evangelists, pastors and teachers, gifts of the Spirit, miracles. Can you say, "Amen?"
    Now, if you want to type that out more... I don't have time to do it, type out Joshua. You
   know across the Jordan is the age of the overcomer, not the millennium. Across the Jordan is
   the age of the overcomer and that represents Divine order. We’ve got to have Divine order,
   Friend, we can't just have chaos among us. We have got to have Divine church order for the
   Holy Spirit to bless us. Amen.

   An Exposition Of The Seven Church Ages - 9 - The Laodicean Church Age
   William Marrion Branham
   Revelation 3:21, “To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with Me in My throne, even as I
   also overcame, and am set down with My Father in His throne.” Now what are we to
   overcome? That is the normal question to ask here. But that is not the actual thought of this
   verse for it is not so much WHAT we are to overcome but HOW we are to overcome. Now this is
   logical, for does it matter much WHAT we are to overcome as long as we know HOW we can
   overcome? A quick look at those Scriptures which involve the Lord Jesus overcoming will bring
   out the truth of this proposition. In Matthew 4, wherein Jesus is tempted of the devil, He
   overcame the personal temptations of Satan by the Word, and by the Word only. In each of the
   The Last Day Ministry

   three major trials that corresponded exactly to the temptation of the Garden of Eden, the lust of
   the flesh, the lust of the eye, and the pride of life, Jesus overcame by the Word. Eve fell to the
   personal temptation of Satan by failing to use the Word. Adam fell in direct disobedience to the
   Word. But Jesus overcame by the Word. And right now, let me say that this is the only way to
   be an overcomer, also it is the only way that you can know if you are overcoming, because that
   Word CAN’T fail. Now notice again how Jesus overcame the world systems of religion. When
   He was repeatedly badgered by the theologians of His day, He constantly applied the Word. He
   spake only what the Father gave Him to speak. There was not a time when the world was not
   utterly confused by His wisdom for it was the wisdom of God. In his own personal life,
   contending with Himself, He overcame by obedience to the Word of God. In Hebrews 5:7 it
   says, “Who in the days of His flesh, when He had offered up prayers and supplications with
   strong crying and tears unto Him That was able to save Him from death, and was heard in
   that He feared; though He were a Son, yet learned He obedience by the things which He
   suffered; and being made perfect, He became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that
   obey Him.” What was He obedient to? The Word of God. Now then, there will not be one
   person who will sit in the throne of the Lord Jesus Christ unless he has been living that Word.
   Your prayers, your fastings, your repentances — no matter what you present to God — none
   of that will gain you the privilege of sitting in that throne. It will be granted only to the WORD
   Bride. As the throne of the king is shared with the queen because she is united to him, so only
   they who are of that Word even as He is of that Word will share that throne. Remember we
   have shown clearly all through the ages that even as Adam and Eve fell because they left the
   Word, so the Ephesian Age fell by turning slightly from the Word, until with every age continuing
   to turn away, we have a final repudiation of the Word by the World Church system. THIS
   LAODICEAN AGE ENDS IN A BLACKOUT OF THE WORD, THEREBY CAUSING A
   DEPARTURE OF THE LORD FROM THE MIDST. HE STANDS OUTSIDE CALLING TO
   HIS OWN WHO FOLLOW HIM BY OBEDIENCE TO THE WORD. After a SHORT AND
   POWERFUL DEMONSTRATION OF THE SPIRIT THIS LITTLE HUNTED AND
   PERSECUTED GROUP WILL GO TO BE WITH JESUS.
    And this will take place in its fullness at the time of the persecution, the press. How much it
   is going to be, I don't know but it will be enough to bring us to our knees, Friend. We will
   never amount to nothing until that comes. Oh, we will struggle along like we are. Some will do
   a little better than the others but most of us will just drag along and the Lord will have to do
   something like that to bring us together in love. We’re not going to love one another until it
   looks like we are going to have to die for one another, probably. Amen.
    So here we have another phase I would like to bring to you. You’re going to hear this sooner
   or later about how "That which is in part is done away with." If you’ll look over in I Corinthians
   13, we’ll read this.
   1 Corinthians 13:8-11-Reading
   8 Charity never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be
   tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away.
   9 For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.
   10 But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away.

   11 When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when
   I became a man, I put away childish things.
    Now, the five-fold ministry will bring the Bride into maturity, which is perfection. The word
   “perfection” in the Greek really means, “fully mature.” The five-fold ministry will bring the
   Bride into full maturity where you’ll all be men and women in the Spirit, no more
   babies. You’ll be men and women in the Spirit. You won't need the gifts of the Spirit to call you
   out and tell you what you did yesterday, that was evil. Amen. There won't be no need for the
   five-fold...
    God gave me this here now. I never got this off a tape, there won't be no need for a five-fold
   ministry anymore, yet it’ll be there but it’ll pass away and go into something greater. You
   growed into maturity now. Amen.
    The Bible said that you would become in the very image of Jesus Christ before the rapture.
   Romans 8:29-Reference quote:
   29 For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son,
   that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.

   IN THESE LAST DAYS THE TRUE BRIDE CHURCH (CHRIST’S SEED) WILL COME
   TO THE HEADSTONE, AND SHE WILL BE THE SUPER CHURCH, A SUPER RACE, AS
   SHE NEARS HIM. THEY IN THE BRIDE WILL BE SO MUCH LIKE HIM THAT THEY
   WILL EVEN BE IN HIS VERY IMAGE. This is in order to be united with Him. THEY WILL
   BE ONE. THEY WILL BE THE VERY MANIFESTATION OF THE WORD OF THE
   LIVING GOD. Denominations cannot produce this (wrong seed). They will produce their creeds
   and their dogmas, mixed with the Word. This mongrelizing brings forth a hybrid product.
    And the five-fold ministry is to bring you into the stature of a perfect man, Jesus Christ. God
   wanted to bring many sons into glory, the Bible said. Amen? God wants His sons to be just like
   Jesus Christ. And that five- fold ministry, the message that’s been given them by the messenger
   prophet, will produce a perfected, fully mature Christian. A man, that’ll be able to stand his
   trials and his testing’s and his tribulations and have the Spirit work through him in the fullness. Can you believe that?
    Now, when we become fully mature, then that which is in part shall be done away
   with. Then the ministry changes from the five-fold ministry into, "As My Heavenly Father sent
   me, so send I you." Amen. And you will do nothing except your Heavenly Father shows you
   first. You’ll do all those things that please your Heavenly Father. You’ll be able to say, "As my
   Heavenly Father worketh, hitherto and I work." Amen? Then you will be, truly, a manifested
   son of the living God in the very image of Jesus Christ. Those manifested sons will take a
   message of judgment to the so called 'House of God'.

   100 And there is a Light of the hour today, that’s Jesus Christ in the power of His
   resurrection, His Word that’s promised for this day. “The works that I do, shall you also;
   greater than this shall you do, for I go to the Father.” GREATER WORKS, GREATER
   THINGS THAN HE DID? Do you believe it? [Congregation says, “Amen.”—Ed.] I believe it.
   It seems humble. It seems like it goes over the top of people’s head. Look when He was here
   on earth, how could you do “greater” works? I’ve translated that, many times, “more,” but the
   same thing. “Greater,” He said in Saint John 14:12, “greater works than this shall you do.”
   101 Did you notice? When He went to make water into wine, He took water, first; an already
   created substance, and turned it into wine. When He fed five thousand people, He took a fish
   that once swam in the water, broke it, hand it out, and multiplied creation. He took bread that
   was once wheat, baked into bread, broke it and hung it out to the…hand it out to the people,
   and it returned back again. Multiplied creation! 102 But in the last days, where there is no
   sign of creation, He speaks it into creation, anyhow, shows to be the same God that was in the
   beginning. He can create squirrels, He can create whatever He wants to, because He is God.
   “Greater things than this will you do, for I go unto My Father.” The Word is infallible, and It
   has to be manifested and has to be fulfilled. “Greater than this shall you do,” not multiplying,
   but speaking out into creation. 103 NOTICE AT THE WORD NOW WHEN HE
   PROMISED. WHERE, WHERE WE AT, THEN? WHAT DAY ARE WE LIVING IN?
   WHAT IS THE HOUR? THE MANIFESTING OF THE WORD OF GOD, LIKE IT IS IN
   ALL HOURS.
    Now, if you notice over here after Elisha received the double portion of the Spirit, it said that
   Elisha journeyed down to Bethel. And the word “Bethel” means, “House of God.” And he went
   down there with a ministry that turned around and cursed irreverence. Amen. Didn't it? Two she
   bears come out and slayed forty-two children.

   go up, thou bald head.
   24 And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of the Lord. And there
   came forth two she bears out of the wood, and tare forty and two children of them.
    I believe that, at the time of the ministry of the manifested sons of God, the Blood has left
   the Mercy Seat and they will take a message to an apostate church world that has rejected the
   messenger-prophet that God sent them. And this will be one next to the last final vindication
   that God sent that Malachi 4 prophet because that Malachi 4, prophet's message produced a
   Bride for Jesus Christ. It produced a manifested son, just like Jesus Christ. Can you say,
   "Amen", Friend? My goodness, this ought to stimulate us something terrible, don't you think

   345 What if it is? Look at the Scriptures piled in here. Could it be? Is the Third Pull to preach to
   the Eternal doomed that’s rejected the Message of salvation? 346 “Well,” you say, “the church
   is going…” Yeah, they will. They’ll go right on, just the same. 347 But, remember, all this time,
   Noah was in the ark. The Bride is sealed in with Christ, the last member has been redeemed.
   The Sixth Seal has produced itself. The Seventh Seal brings Him back to earth. The Lamb
   come and took the Book out of the right hand of Him, and set down and claimed what He
   owned, what He had redeemed. That right? It’s always been that Third Pull. 348 Three is
   perfection. THE MINISTRY COME TO ITS PERFECTION WHEN IT REPRODUCED
   CHRIST AGAIN IN NATURAL, AMONGST HUMAN BEINGS, AS WAS PREDICTED, “As

    How many want to be a manifested son of God? Then this manifested son will take a
   message of judgment to a church world that is apostate. And there is only one thing for an
   apostate and that is the wrath and judgments of God. It’ll be a wrath and judgment ministry
   because they rejected their message.

   it? Out of the dust of the earth, out of the bottom of the sea, out of the pits, out of everywhere and

   every place, out of—out of the regions of the dark, out of paradise, wherever they may be. He’ll
   call, and they’ll answer. Amen! Amen! [Congregation says, “Amen.”—Ed.] He’ll call, and
   they’ll answer. 268 He come to get His subjects. He revealed His secrets, and they saw It. “And
   time is no more,” at that time. “Time has run out.” It’s finished. All right. 269 HE LEAVES
   THE THRONE, TO BE AN INTERCESSOR, AS A SLAIN LAMB; TO BE A LION, KING;
   TO BRING THE WORLD TO JUDGMENT, WHO HAS REJECTED HIS MESSAGE. He’s
   not a Mediator. 270 Remember the Old Testament teaching now, as we hurry. When the blood
   went off the mercy seat, what was it? Judgment seat. 271 And when the Lamb, slain, walked
   forward from Eternity, out of the Father’s Throne, and took His rights, it was a Judgment
   Seat. Then He become, not a Lamb, but a Lion, King, and He calls for His Queen to come
   stand by His side. 272 “Know ye not the saints shall judge the earth?” Daniel said, “The
   Judgment was set, and the books were opened; and ten thousands times ten thousands of
   thousand ministered to Him,” King and Queen. “And then another Book was opened, which was
   the Book of Life,” that’s for the church. And the Queen and the King stood there.
    Apostate... You know there’s a difference between an apostate and ignorance. You can be in
   ignorance and not be an apostate. A man can be in Bible ignorance but, when a little humble
   brother comes along and preaches the truth, he’ll say, "Amen. I want out of this
   ignorance." Amen? And you say, "Well, bless the Lord, I don't believe that. Amen. I don't
   believe that." And then it’s fully vindicated, you become an apostate and God is going to
   destroy you with the Spirit of His mouth. What a terrible thing that our Brothers out here claim
   to be the Apostolic Church of the hour and they are APOSTATE.

   240 But there was two out of the twelve, Joshua and Caleb, said they looked at the Word. “God
   said it’s ours, and we are more than able to take it.” Is that right? [Congregation says,
   “Amen.”—Ed.] 241 What was that? Borderline believers. See, they were actually born in the
   church. They were heads of the people. They were bishops, as to say, that walked right down to
   where the Word of God was shown to be the Truth. “There is the land!” They had never been
   there. They didn’t know it was there. But they come down to see it was there. “There it was!”
   And Caleb and Joshua went over, and brought back a—a—a bunch of grapes and let them eat
   some of it. And they tasted of the good land, and then went back and said, “We can’t do it. See?
   We just can’t do it.” 242 Here is the same group, in the time of Jesus Christ. “Rabbi, we know
   Thou art a teacher come from God.” See? Borderline! “We know Thou art a teacher come from
   God. No man could do the things that You do. We recognize that God has to be there.” Why
   didn’t they accept it? Why didn’t they take it? Borderline! Borderline! 243 Here they are on
   this third exodus; same sign, same manifestation, same Christ, same Holy Ghost, same works,
   same God, same Message, and they can’t take It. They’d have to give up their fellowship card.
   What is it? “They’ve had a knowledge of the Truth.” They looked and seen that it’s absolutely
   the Truth. They can’t deny It. The magazines has to testify they seen It. The pictures, the
   papers, the evidence, the resurrection of the dead, the doctors’ statements of the sick, they
   The Last Day Ministry

   have to say that it’s Him. And the predictions, not one of them ever failing down through the
   years, every one of them just exactly on the dot, they can’t say but what it’s God. BUT THEY
   CAN’T ACCEPT IT. 244 That bunch of ministers in Chicago, three hundred and something of
   them, was going to come down and be baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ. Where they at? The
   price is too great. They can’t do it. What is it? The Bible said, when they do that, what do they
   do? They separate themselves between mercy and judgment. “For it is impossible for those
   that were once enlightened,” has been brought to look at It, “and had a knowledge of the
   Truth, and have tasted of the good Word of God, if they return away from It, where they’d
   have to renew themselves again, say, ‘Well, now, I will, yes,…’” 245 You Presbyterians, you
   Methodists, and Baptists, and Lutherans, and this Full Gospel Business Men’s stuff, saying
   they’re “coming in,” turned away the Message. Your church will. There’ll be individuals in
   there, sure. But, not the church; you have to come out of the church, to get It. See? That’s right.
   Individuals is all right. 246 But when you think the Presbyterian church is going to receive the
   Holy Ghost, and all of them take their documents down, and, don’t you never think that. And you
   think you Methodists is going to do it? You’ll never do it. Do you think you Trinitarians will ever
   receive the Name of Jesus Christ and be baptized every one of you in the…You’ll never do it.
   You’ll never do it. But individuals will come out and do it, that’s right, and that’s the sign of His
   Coming. But them churches who has seen the Truth, and rejected It in their councils, “it’s
   impossible.” 247 THEN, THEY’RE GUILTY OF THE CRUCIFIXION OF JESUS CHRIST.
   AND I INDICT THEM BY THE WORD OF GOD, THAT GOD HAS… “HOW DO YOU
   INDICT THEM, BROTHER BRANHAM?” I INDICT THEM, THAT GOD HAS CLEARLY
   IDENTIFIED HIMSELF IN HIS WORD, IN THE LAST DAYS, AND MADE HISSELF TO
   KNOW THAT HE IS STILL THE SAME YESTERDAY, TODAY, AND FOREVER, AND
   THEY’VE COLDLY TURNED IT DOWN. AND YOU’RE GUILTY OF THE CRUCIFIXION
   OF JESUS CHRIST, BY BLASPHEMING THE HOLY GHOST. That’s right. 248 We take
   you on to Hebrews 10, again, where it tells us again in the Scriptures, not only being
   “impossible,” but you can never. It separates you from God, Eternally. You can never come in
   the Presence of God again, when you turn down the Holy Ghost and make fun of It. 249 Now,
   see, “have tasted of the Word.” See, borderline believers! “Oh, you say them guys wasn’t
   believers?” 250 They was believers, or professed believers, but when it come to the Word…They
   were Israel. They come out under the blood. They come out under the signs of Moses. They had
   seen those signs working. God said, “I’ll take you over yonder.” 251 And when it come right
   down to the principle of the promised Word that was to come, what’d they say? “Oh, we can’t do
   it.” See? 252 And here they come back, with grapes and everything, to prove the land was right.
   God’s Word is right. God said, “I give it to you.” 253 But the circumstances, “My,” said, “we
   look like grasshoppers, up aside of them. We can’t do it, no matter what.” 254 A few years ago
   when this old hull stood here as a tabernacle, somebody come in, and walked out there and
   talked to me, said, “Billy, you’re going to preach to four posts, one of these days, with Messages
   like that.” 255 I said, “I’ll be preaching to four posts, ’cause God’s able of them posts to rise
   children unto Abraham.” Yes, sir. It’s the Truth. I said, “If you’ve got something that you can
   disprove It, let’s have it.” Just love to crow, but when it comes to a place to show it, that’s
   different. Yes, that’s what makes the difference. All right. 256 Yeah, with their creeds they
   crucify Him afresh. Now Hebrews the 6th chapter, and we go on down. And we could just read
   on down, on down in through here. We got plenty of time. I marked out a Scripture here where it
   will be, Hebrews the 6th chapter. Just, I guess, take it all. “Impossible for those who were once
   enlightened, made partakers of the Holy Ghost…” We haven’t got time to go too far, ’cause I got

   the Son of God afresh.” What’d they do? What? By having a taste, and knowing that It’s the
   Truth, and then turn around and denying It. What’d it do? “It’s impossible…”
    And God is going to slay them with that manifested son, even slay them with the Mount
   Carmel showdown but that won't be enough, either. God will still pour it on them after that. And
   He’ll tell them through these manifested sons, "Ye have rejected the Word of the Lord, through
   my prophet." And the wrath of God Almighty will fall on them, I tell ya. The prophet said that
   this group would even call plagues down upon them. Yes, it is going to be terrific. I don't know

   about ready to spread forth her branches now. I believe it, this great Message and great thing, I

   going to take but we have got to get a desperation from somewhere. We can't go on the way
   we’re going in the deadness and the Luke warmness that we’re in. We’re far from what God has
   for us. Can you say it’s true? We need a shaking among us. We need to be so stimulated that we
   can come and stand without the preacher asking us to stand.
    I’ve seen the Spirit moving the assembly in New York, where you couldn't get the people to
   sit back down. Just roar... You could hear them clear up the Empire State Building, clear up the

   don't mean nothing emotional; I mean tears a streaming down their face. Oh, that is one
   assembly, I tell ya, I told a Brother that they’re moving off and leaving some of the

   our soul to come together in unity and of a perfect mind that Christ might be manifested among
   us where we can feel the anointed presence of Christ to convict us. And the Bible said that,
   The Last Day Ministry
   
   43
   "God was near a broken and a contrite heart." We’ve got to be broken. A lot of us our tear ducts
   in our eyes have been stopped up so long that we can't even cry. Amen.
   Psalm 34:18-19-Reference quote:
   18 The Lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart; and saveth such as be of a contrite
   spirit.
   19 Many are the afflictions of the righteous: but the Lord delivereth him out of them all.
    Boy, I tell ya, we’re in desperate need in this hour to get a burden. We need a burden. Let us
   pray that God will lay a burden upon our heart that we’ll begin to be concerned about our
   neighbors and about the world and about the Bride. Oh, there’s so much that we could do, if we
   would do it, you know it. But the things that we ought to do we won't do it, see? We want to
   do...
    Many want to be chiefs and nobody wants to be Indians. I tell ya, if you can't be a pine upon
   the hill, be a scrub down in the valley but be the best scrub down there. Be the best one down
   there. God ain't called me to be a pine on the hill, maybe, but if he hadn't, thank God for it
   anyway. I’d have probably got humble and puffed up but I have got to make me a best scrub
   down in the valley then with some fruit on it. Amen.
    The Bible said when you see the churches, the seven churches go together with the Pope,
   said, "In that day shall the Branch of the Lord be beautiful and God shall wash away the filth of
   the daughters of Zion through the Spirit of judgment and burning."
   Isaiah 4:2-Reference quote:
   2 In that day shall the branch of the Lord be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the earth
   shall be excellent and comely for them that are escaped of Israel.
   Isaiah 4:4-Reference quote:
   4 When the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall have
   purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit
   of burning.
    I tell ya, there is going to come a flame of Fire from the Holy Ghost that is going to burn
   away every bit of dross in us and every bit of sin that is hanging on us. It’s goin burn it off of
   us. Said, "Zion shall be redeemed by judgment. And judgment shall begin at the House of
   God." God is not going to judge an apostate world out here with a ministry that is in sin their
   self. Judgment is going to start at the House of God.
    We’re gonna have Ananias and Sapphira again, right among us. It has to be. I pray to God I
   ain't the first one. Yes. Amen. It’s coming. The Bible said that a sinner shall not be able to stand
   in the congregation of the righteous.
   Psalm 1:5-Reference quote:
   5 Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the
   righteous.

   24 Like a fellow come in the prayer line, put a… He thought it was telepathy, ’cause he wrote it
   on a prayer card. He wrote on there he had TB, and everything. He come in the line, said, he
   said, “How do you do?” And I said, “How do you do, sir?” And he said, I said, “Well, do you
   believe me to be His servant?” See, that’s what the Angel told; Get the people to believe you.
   “Yes, sir.” That didn’t sound right. It didn’t register. See, in myself I’d… Why, he was a fine
   looking man, just as nice-looking fellow. I said, “Yes, sir.” Got talking to him, and I said,
   “There’s nothing wrong with you; you’re perfectly healthy.” Said, “You’re wrong.” I said, “No,
   I’m not.” He said, “Get that prayer card down there and look.” Said, “I got TB, cancer,” I don’t
   know what all he had wrote… I said, “I don’t care what you got on that prayer card,” I said,
   “there’s nothing wrong with you.” He said, “Well, I’ve got it on my prayer card.” 25 I said,
   “That don’t hurt…” I said, “I don’t care what you put on your prayer card, that doesn’t mean a
   thing. (See?) It’s what the Holy Spirit says.” And he said, “Well, it is…” I said, “Well, maybe
   you had faith enough to get healed ’fore you come in the meeting. I…” He said, “And that’s the
   way it is…” And I thought, “What’s going on here?” He looked like he was Christian man.
   Looked around, there I looked over on the wall, like towards this way, and there I seen it, moving
   out. And I turned around to him. Many setting here now was right in the meeting when it
   happened. And I—I said “Why, why would you let the devil put such a thing as that in your
   mind?” I said, “Now, you are a certain church,” I won’t call the name, “that don’t believe. The
   days of miracles is past. And you was at the meeting the other night and told me, and—and said,
   within yourself rather, that this was nothing but a mental telepathy.” And I said, “That man
   setting right yonder in the balcony with the red tie on and the gray suit, you was in his house the
   other night; you was setting at a table had a cloth pulled over it like this, and you made up in
   your mind that you was going to come down here and write that on your prayer card, and come
   in here.” And that man screamed out and said, “That is the living truth,” setting up in the
   platform like that. 26 And I said, “Because that you have said, and put that on your prayer card,
   now you have it.” And he died about six weeks afterwards. See, we’re not playing, church.
   We’re living in the Presence of the Holy Ghost.” Remember Ananias and Sapphira? You
   better be sincere and correct with God before you try that. Remember, “It’s a fearful thing to
   fall into the hands of the living God.” See? There it was. It come right upon him, and the
   diagnosis of the case and everything, showed he had both cancer and TB. He said it, he—and his
   words come to pass. That’s just exactly. He sealed his own doom, just exactly.
   
    You take one little woman... I challenge you women in here, to not to talk on the telephone
   or run from house to house. I have been in assemblies where, at eight o'clock, Mary goes and
   visits Suzy and then Suzy goes and visits Jane. And at ten-thirty Helen goes over and visits
   Mary Ann. And continually back and forth they just wear the road out. Never have I ever went
   in and caught one of them in a prayer closet, praying.

   preacher can't hardly get anointed. Amen. Oh, but for that woman that will forget about
   everything... Oh boy, I tell you, it is just such a need, it just eats at me all the time.
    I tell you; I just want to see Jesus. My goodness. He’s done so much for us. Hasn't He? He
   is so lovely. He’s the only thing in this world that is worth anything. I mean, after all, after all is
   over, only what is done for Jesus is worth anything. And it’s the only life that you and I
   have. Sometimes I just sit and cry and go up the road and drive my car crying and go to sleep a
   crying, say, "God, I’ve got to be a blessing, Lord, it is the only life I have got. And it’s almost
   over and yet, I haven't been a blessing yet. When am I going to be?"
    Oh God! Shake us, or do something with us, Lord, to wake us up in this last hour! We that
   claim to be the Bride of Christ, we need to be broken before the Lord. That purging that comes
   from the Holy Ghost that breaks us up, is what... Oh, it cleanses. And, when you come out of
   prayer like that, you feel clean, feel close to the Lord. Oh, we need, we need the Holy Spirit so
   bad. We need to travail and groan, hunger and thirst after the Holy Spirit. Let us stand to our
   feet.
    Oh, I love you. Oh, how I hope you will pray for me. Friend, you are looking at the biggest
   failure that ever was. The less I preach, the less I want to preach. The less I pray, the less I want
   to pray. The less I read my Bible, the less I want to read my Bible. Until I have to cry out like
   old Paul, "O Lord, what shall deliver me from this curse that I am living in, this body?"
   Romans 7:24-Reference quote:
   24 O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?
    Jesus Christ showed me one night, about three o'clock in the morning... I went to bed
   crying. I said, "God, it’s been months since I heard that still small voice. Lord, I yearn to hear
   it. God, I know that I am such a sinner, you can't speak to me." And I started telling my wife
   about it and I said, "Oh, it is all right, honey, no use to worrying you." And I cried myself to
   sleep and about three o'clock in the morning, here He come. Called out that thing that I was
   doing and said, "Stop that foolishness..." (Tape broke and was unable to repair)

     How many would like to be remembered in prayer, tonight? You have something on
    your heart, you want Jesus to do for you, tonight? I believe that Jesus is alive. I believe He’s
    resurrected and I believe He’s the same yesterday, today and forever.”
    Hebrews 13:8-Reference quote:
    8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.
    And I believe that the Scripture said, "What can separate us from the Love of God?"
    Romans 8:35-Reference quote:
    35 Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution,
    or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?
    And I believe the bible and I believe that the Bible said that, "Perfect Love casts out fear." And I
    don't believe that is my perfect love for Jesus. I believe that is his perfect Love for me, It’s so
    perfect it should cast out every fear that I have, tonight.
    1 John 4:18-Reference quote:
    18 There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that
    feareth is not made perfect in love.
    
    I don't need to fear cancer; I don't need to fear heart trouble; I don't need to fear
    anything that the devil may put upon me. And, though it may be upon me, I can still say, “Yes, it
    is upon me, but by His stripes I am healed and He loved me with a perfect love and I just cast out
    this fear, tonight."
    How about if you have a fear, tonight. While Brother Bob is preaching the Word of the
    Living God to you, why don't you just let the word of God cast that fear out, tonight, and accept
    healing, deliverance, whatever you want Jesus Christ to do for you, tonight. I believe that Jesus is
    the word and that he will do what He said he would do. If you’d like to be remembered in prayer,
    with an uplifted hand, let me pray for you?
    Our Heavenly Father, you seen every hand go up, Lord. You know what is in the heart,
    Father. You know every burden, Lord. You know the sicknesses in the body, Father. Lord, you
    know the sins and the shortcomings that we did, Lord. And, Heavenly Father, we pray that
    you’d forgive us of our sins, tonight, Lord. God, we pray, as David prayed, "God, return unto us,
    Lord, the joy of our salvation."

    Psalm 51:12-Reference quote:

    Psalm 51:10-Reference quote:
    10 Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me.
    Create in us a right attitude, Father; create in us a burden for this lost and dying world, God;
    create in us, Lord, a concern, Heavenly Father, for this message of the end time, Lord, that it
    would go around the world and bring deliverance to your people that are bound down by
    organizations and denominations and headships of man, Lord. Father God, let your word come,
    tonight, Lord, and open up the hearts of the people, Father. And let the unadulterated word of the
    Living God sink down into the ground of our heart that it may bring forth fruit unto Eternal Life.

    Now, This is always, fundamentally, the correct Word of God, the Bible, every bit of It inspired.
    And It’s all God’s Word, and God is in His Word. So if God is in His Word, then if you receive
    the Word, you receive God. Now that is God’s plan, God’s motive, God’s attitude, God’s love,
    God’s salvation. Everything rests in His printed Word. And if those Words are just like grains,
    or seed that you could pick out and swallow, every one of them would produce just exactly
    what it says it’ll do here. But by faith we receive them.
    Lord, circumcise, tonight, Father God, our ears that we may hear what the Holy Ghost
    would speak through your word, tonight, Father. God, take full control of this meeting,
    Lord. Heavenly Father, have the preeminence of this meeting, Father God, because we want to
    exalt the Name of Jesus Christ and the word of God.
    Heavenly Father, we’re not exalting man, in this hour. But, O God, you said that the
    day of the Lord would come and all that exalted themselves would be brought low and the Lord
    Jesus Christ Himself will be exalted in this day. Lord, this is the day of the Lord Jesus Christ.
    And we pray, God, that You’d come and exalt your word high, tonight, Father. Lift it up, Lord,
    and make it high and glorify your Name.
    John 12:28-Reference quote:
    28 Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified
    it, and will glorify it again.
    
    In Jesus Christ's Name, Lord, I pray that you’ll bless every hand that went up, Father,
    and that you’ll answer the desire of their hearts, according to your riches in Glory. Father God, I
    pray that your able to shut the mouth of every preacher, Lord, and I pray, God, that you would

    pray. Amen.
    Well, I feel good, tonight. I’m happy to be in this little prayer meeting, again, this
    Friday night. And we got no creed, we’ve got nothing to join. But we do have something to lift
    up and that is the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ and this end time message. Which we believe
    that this message of this end time that was brought by the messenger and prophet of Malachi 4
    and Revelation 10:7, that said, "When He begins to sound, this seventh angel to the seventh
    church age when He begins to sound, the mysteries of God shall be finished.” That you have
    wondered about down through the ages of time. God's prophetic anointing through the eagle
    anointing of this end time would bring to pass and unveil the mysteries of the Lord Jesus Christ,
    the word.

    And He sent me back, said that the time was at hand for these Seven Seals which held the
    seven mysteries of the entire Bible, was sealed in with these Seven Seals. And how these angels
    down along the road, messengers of the Church Ages, opened to a certain part of that. But in
    the seventh hour, the seventh messenger, that all these mysteries should be finished. See? The
    seventh earthly messenger, see, this angel that He speaks of then was on earth. AN ANGEL
    MEANS “MESSENGER.” AND THEN, AFTER THAT, HE SAW ANOTHER ANGEL
    COMING DOWN, NOT THE EARTHLY ANGEL THAT HAD BEEN GIVEN THE
    MESSAGE HERE, BUT THE (ANOTHER) MIGHTY ANGEL CAME FROM HEAVEN
    WITH A RAINBOW OVER HIM, AND SET HIS FOOT ON THE LAND AND SEA, AND
    SWORE BY HIM THAT LIVES FOREVER AND EVER, “TIME SHALL BE NO MORE.”

    believe what the Bible says is true? [The brother says, "Yes, sir."—Ed.] 270 You believe that
    this is the hour that Jesus is to come; that the Church has come from justification,
    sanctification, baptism of the Holy Spirit, just like the pyramid like that coming? And now the
    top stone is going to have to be so perfect till, when the Headstone comes, it has to blend right
    with it. The ministry has to start out like this, and just come to the minority all the time, getting
    smaller groups, and smaller group, until finally the Stone meets with the building. He is the
    Headstone, takes the whole building with Him, which is the Church. All of them will raise up,
    plumb back from this first watch, on to the seventh, and all go in the Rapture. Each one had their
    day allotted to them, and they had their reformers and founders, and so forth, all down through.
    AND THIS LAST DAY, IT COME INTO AN EAGLE AGAIN, WHICH IS BACK IN THE
    PROPHETIC AGE, TO BRING THIS TOGETHER. 271 DO YOU BELIEVE THAT, THE
    WORD AND STONE, THE COMING ONE? [The brother says, "I do."—Ed.] You have a very
    fine feeling to you, sir.
    
    So, we are happy to be here tonight, from over in Many (Louisiana) and we’ve been
    preaching a little meeting over in Many, the last few nights. And we feel like the Lord has been
    blessing us over there with His word. And we’re trying to get this old Laodicean spirit rebuked
    off of us. Amen?
    I think we preach a lot about the Laodicean Church but you know, we’re that Church,
    you know. And I believe that old Laodicean spirit has got over on the Bride. And I don't believe
    that we need to have that spirit on us. I think we need to rebuke that old lazy spirit off of us. And
    you know, the Apostle Paul, he knew how lazy them was and that’s why he said that, "Men
    ought always to pray and not to turn coward and faint." But I think that men ought always to
    pray and not to faint.
    Luke 18:1-Reference quote:
    1 And he spake a parable unto them to this end, that men ought always to pray, and not to faint;
    And the Bible said, "If you’ll reap to the spirit, you’ll of the Spirit reap Life
    Everlasting and if you sow to the flesh, you’ll of the flesh reap destruction and corruption. Is,
    that Right?
    Galatians 6:7-9-Reference quote:
    7 Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.
    8 For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the
    Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.
    9 And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.
    
    So, Friend, you’ll only pass this way one time and these days are fleeting by. The
    Rapture of the Lord Jesus Christ is at hand. And by nineteen and seventy-three and a half and not
    later than nineteen and seventy-seven, according to the revelation of the Book of Daniel that was
    given to this prophet and messenger, that we know without a shadow of a doubt, that as sure
    as Elisha stayed with the word of Elijah and as sure as Jehu fulfilled the word of Elijah the

    5
    prophet, so shall it be in this day, that every word that the prophet said shall come to pass,
    according as he spoke in the Name of the Lord.
    We believe that this Church Age will be terminated by nineteen and seventy-seven, if
    not before then. So, Friend, you don't have many days left and you’re only passing by this one
    time, through this earth. And the old saying is: "Only what’s done for Jesus will last." I forget the
    first words. Who’s that? "Soon this time will be past and only what is done for Jesus will last," or
    something to that effect. Meaning that, what you’re gonna do, do it quickly.

    212 Now, then, after that, I turned and looked. And I saw this United States burning like a
    smolder, rocks had been blowed up. And it was burning like a—a heap of fire in logs, or
    something that just set it afire. And looked as far as I could see, and she had been blown up. And
    then the vision left me. Five out of the three has happened…or five out of the seven, rather, has
    happened. 213 And here comes around and shows. And then I predicted. I never said the Lord
    told me that, but, standing that morning in the church, I said, “The way progress…” I got back
    to one end of their wall, and run to the other end of the wall. I said, “The way progress is going
    on, I’ll predict that the time…I don’t know why I’m saying it. But I predict that that’ll all
    happen between right now, 1933, and 1977.” And not knowing it, God knows my heart, I never

    owned, what He had redeemed. That right? It’s always been that Third Pull. 348 Three is
    perfection. THE MINISTRY COME TO ITS PERFECTION WHEN IT REPRODUCED
    CHRIST AGAIN IN NATURAL, AMONGST HUMAN BEINGS, AS WAS PREDICTED, “As
    it was in the days of Lot.”
    So, I pray that God… if you want to be an overcomer, you’re gonna have to have a
    prayer life. Amen. You had better sit down and count the cost. You can't… It’s not an hour for
    bein “wishy-washy” and “dilly-dallying” around. We need to get on fire for Jesus Christ. And I
    don't believe you can have a hunger for the word of God unless you have a prayer life. Amen. I
    believe we need to be exerting every effort that we have to make sure that the virtues of the Lord
    Jesus Christ are made manifested in us. Can you say, Amen?
    All right, now, if God lays upon your heart, tonight, that you want to accept one of these
    hours of prayer. Whether, it is nine o'clock and we pray around the clock twenty-four hours. nine
    o'clock, twelve o'clock and three o'clock. I choose the three o'clock because I like to get up that
    time of morning, while the devil is kind of resting that time of morning. Everybody… his
    subjects are all asleep.
    So, that is the best time to pray through is three o'clock in the morning between three
    and five. When them devils get to moving around about seven o'clock, cursing and carrying on
    and get up with their hangovers, it’s better to pray at three o'clock in the morning. I find that is
    the best hour, so… That is the hardest hour to get up, though. Amen?
    But maybe you’d like to, doesn’t make any difference which hour you’d like to
    choose. And probably you don't want to choose any, don't want to obligate yourself. But let me
    give you a little warning, let me just read this to you over here. Kind of might stir you up to pray
    a little bit. I’m not going to preach on prayer, tonight, but maybe I will, one of these nights. Says
    over in Proverbs 1:23, it says:
    Proverbs 1:23-29-Reading:
    23 Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my
    words unto you.
    24 Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded;
    25 But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof:
    26 I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh;
    27 When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when
    distress and anguish cometh upon you.
    28 Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall
    not find me:
    29 For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the Lord:
    I’d just like to preach on that, if I didn’t have this other message God laid on my
    heart. That’s what’s the matter with this Pentecostal Church Age. They wouldn’t turn at the
    reproof of God through his prophets. And when their calamity comes upon them as the destruction
    of a whirlwind, then they’ll pray early and then they’ll seek God early. But God said he’d hide his
    face from them because they would not turn at his instruction of his word.

    8
    So that should encourage us, it has me. It’s kind of… That proverb has kind of stimulated
    my desire to seek the face of the Lord God. Now he… (A Sister stands up in the middle of Brother
    Lambert talking and requests to change her prayer hour time)
    The Lord bless you, Sis, that would be fine. This sister is from down in Longhorn, Texas,
    and she has been with us for a long time... Longview, Texas, and she has been over in our meeting
    that we’ve been preaching and God has laid it upon her heart to overcome and make sure that the
    word of God is being manifested in her life. And we certainly appreciate that.
    Now, we are going to get right into this little short message. Not going to preach to you
    long. But if you’ll open your Bibles to the 19th Chapter of Matthew and the 12th verse, I would
    like to take for a subject, "The Eunuchs Of The Lord Jesus Christ." And for a text, I would like to
    take, "Preparation For The Marriage Of The Lamb." Now, reading from Matthew 19:12, it said:
    Matthew 19:12-Reading:
    12 For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their mother's womb: and there are
    some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs, which have made
    themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive
    it.
    And now, if you’ll open your Bibles to the book of Esther. Now, we have a lot of big
    words in here that... I ‘m uneducated. I just went to a very small number of years in school. And
    some of these words are so big, I don't know whether I can pronounce them right. So, you just
    look over my ignorance and I’ll just do the best that I can to pronounce them.
    Esther 1:1-2-Reading:
    1 Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus, (this is Ahasuerus which reigned, from India
    even unto Ethiopia, over an hundred and seven and twenty provinces:)
    2 That in those days, when the king Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom, which was in
    Shushan the palace,
    3 In the third year of his reign, he made a feast unto all his princes and his servants; the power
    of Persia and Media, the nobles and princes of the provinces, being before him:
    4 When he shewed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honour of his excellent majesty
    many days, even an hundred and fourscore days.
    5 And when these days were expired, the king made a feast unto all the people that were present
    in Shushan the palace, both unto great and small, seven days, in the court of the garden of the
    king's palace;
    Now, it goes on here and I’d like to call your attention to the 10th verse and it says, 9th
    verse, it says.
    Esther 1:9-12-Scripture Reading:
    09 Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to king
    Ahasuerus.
    10 On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded
    Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains
    that served in the presence of Ahasuerus the king,

    9
    11 To bring Vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal, to shew the people and the
    princes her beauty: for she was fair to look on.
    12 But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king's commandment by his chamberlains:
    therefore was the king very wroth, and his anger burned in him.
    Yesterday, I rose up in the morning and prayed and during the day I began to get moody
    and kind of depressed and burdened. And my wife went up town. And my hour of prayer came to
    pray and of course I study and pray most of the day but I made a point to especially pray at that
    very hour. No matter how much you pray, now.
    But I went into the bedroom and the Holy Spirit begin to deal with me and began to cry
    out to the Lord. And these words came to me in the Spirit and said, "Prepare My Body, prepare
    My Body." Well, I got to thinking, what did the Lord mean? Prepare My Body.” And It said,
    "Make ready for the marriage, make ready for the marriage and prepare My Body." And then it
    came to me to read Esther. And then when I got up off my knees and read Esther, the Lord give
    me this little message.
    Hebrews 10:5-13-Reference quote:
    5 Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not,
    but a body hast thou prepared me:
    6 In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure.
    7 Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me,) to do thy will, O God.
    8 Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin thou
    wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure therein; which are offered by the law;
    9 Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He taketh away the first, that he may establish
    the second.
    10 By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for
    all.
    11 And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices,
    which can never take away sins:
    12 But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand
    of God;
    13 From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool.

    62-1111M - Dedication
    William Marrion Branham
    84 Then, how beautiful Hebrews 10:5, “But a Body has thou prepared Me,” showing that God
    was going to dwell in a Body. [Blank spot on tape—Ed.] “…prepared Me.” Oh! And when this
    body had been made a sacrifice, the correct Lamb had been sacrificed, there was coming forth
    then, God came to His Own Body, which was His Bride. 85 And there had been a hundred and
    twenty temples that God had created, was ready for dedication, that had got all their unbelief beat
    out of them. And they gathered in the upper room, and waited for ten days, for dedicational
    service. Then when completely surrendered, God came down again in the Shekinah glory, and
    filled all the house where they were setting. What did God do? Like the ark dropping into its

    10
    proper sockets for the message of that day, God dropped back into His proper channel; not into a
    denomination or into a building made with hands, but into the heart of men. He dropped in His
    place, for the last day, which said the prophet Joel. “It shall come to pass in the last days, I’ll
    pour out My Shekinah upon all flesh. Your sons and daughters shall prophesy. Your young men
    shall dream dreams. The old men shall see visions.” God came to His resting place, where He
    finds rest. Not in a building, but in the heart of His people, He finds rest.
    And if you’ll notice here, that this king was having a feast. And he called all the peoples
    to this feast. And he began to show his great riches; he showed his great power and he was
    showing all of the glories of his kingdom to this people. And I am kind of typing that with this
    Pentecostal revival that started about l906. When God began to show forth his great power of his
    kingdom, when he began to do great mighty signs and wonders and miracles and began to show
    forth the great treasures of his heavenly kingdom that he wanted to give unto his people.
    And then, it said here in the 10th verse, "That on the seventh day of the feast..." And I am
    thinking and typing this seventh day of this feast with the Seventh Church Age that this
    Pentecostal revival has come to, this Seventh Church Age. And, at this seventh day, this king had
    his seven chamberlains. And this word “chamberlain” is a eunuch.
    And I want you to know, tonight, that a eunuch has no seed of his own. He is a man that
    has no seed. Therefore, he does not get married because he has no will of his own because he has
    no seed to plant. He cannot raise no children of his own. And that king, in those days, used a
    eunuch, a chamberlain, to take care of their wives, their concubines and their maidens.
    And I am typing this, eunuchs of the king, here, that he was sending forth to bring the
    queen, to show her off before his subjects. And I am typing that with these eunuchs,
    chamberlains, with the faithful ministers of the Lord Jesus Christ, his spiritual eunuchs of this last
    church age, before it’s raptured.
    Now, you notice here, that on the seventh day the king sent these eunuchs to call forth his
    queen to come that he might show her off. And we find out that she wouldn’t come at the call of
    the eunuchs. On the seventh day, she wouldn’t come.
    And I want you to know that God began to show forth the mighty manifestation of His
    Power down through this Laodicean Church Age. He began to show forth the Bible that said, "Eye
    hath not seen nor ear heard what is... the great things that God has prepared for those that love
    Him, but He has revealed them unto us, in His Word." And so, in this latter day of this Pentecostal
    Outpouring, in this latter day, God has showed forth his great power and his great glories, his
    treasures of heaven, and he manifested them in the outpouring of the holy ghost.
    So, he let them see his treasures for these many days. They looked upon the treasures of
    the king. But on the seventh day, on the seventh day, he called a special meeting. On the Seventh
    day, which I am typing with the Seventh Church Age, this king sent forth his seven chamberlains,
    which were eunuchs, to call the queen. And we find out the queen rebelled and didn’t come at the
    request of the eunuchs. That’s a striking thing. I hope you’re spiritual, now, and you are getting
    this.
    God, at this hour, in this last day, after he’d showed the manifestation of his power and
    his glory of heaven, in the Seventh Church Age sent forth a messenger of Malachi 4, a prophet,
    which was a eunuch. He was a eunuch because he did not have any seed of his own to plant. He

    11
    only planted the unadulterated word of the living God to restore the hearts of the children back to
    the Apostolic Fathers.
    He was a eunuch. And he came to call the so-called Queen of Pentecost to come to the
    marriage supper of the Lamb. And she turned it down because she was having a supper of her
    own. That is exactly what has happened. She turned it down because she was having a feast of her
    own. In other words, she was turning down the Headship of the King, Jesus Christ. She was not in
    obedience to the word of God. And she said, "We are having a little feast over here ourselves and
    we’re tryin to be one with the World Council of Churches."

    390 Is this the mystery, OF THE THUNDERS, THAT WILL BRING BACK THE
    HEADSTONE? You know, the pyramid never was capped. THE HEADSTONE IS YET TO
    COME. IT’S BEEN REJECTED. Could it be, brethren, sisters? 391 Or, is this that Third Pull
    that He told me, three or four years ago? 392 The First Pull, you remember what happened? I

    pulled, anyhow. You remember? [Congregation says, “Yes.”—Ed.] All of you remember. It’s on
    tape and everything. 394 And then He said, “NOW THERE’S A THIRD PULL COMING, but
    don’t try to explain It.” You see how I approached This, tonight? I don’t know. But, I feel duty

     And that is just what’s happening, in this hour, that the Pentecostal queen, that has seen the
    glories of God, is getting ready to unite in a feast of the World Council of Churches. And she
    turned down the invitation of the eunuch of the Lord God, that did not have a will of his own. He
    did not have any seed of his own. He only planted the seed of his Heavenly Father. And she turned
    it down in the Seventh Church Age, the seventh day. She turned it down and would not come. She
    had a feast of her own to go to. Refuses the Headship of Christ.

    61-0806 - The Seventieth Week Of Daniel
    William Marrion Branham
    This person that was to come forth, this Message, rather, that was to come forth, was to be like
    Elijah. Elijah was to come three times. Now you say, that, “John the Baptist was that guy.” IF
    YOU NOTICE, JESUS SAID IT WAS JOHN THE BAPTIST WAS THE MESSENGER OF
    MALACHI 3, NOT MALACHI 4. “BEHOLD, I SEND MY MESSENGER BEFORE MY
    FACE.” I think Matthew 11:6, right down along in there you’ll find it, Matthew the 11th
    chapter. 147 Now, but in this last days, there is to come a Spirit of Elijah amongst the people,
    and he is to do the same thing that they did back there. His nature would be the same thing,
    the nature of the Church. The nature of the—the person would be exactly the same thing.
    AND THAT MESSAGE GOING OUT, TRY…HE WOULD BE HATED, WITH THE
    PEOPLE. He would hate women, ornery ones, anyhow, bad ones. Love the wilderness; moody,
    upset guy all the time, like Elijah was, and like John was. And we’ve seen all this thing come to
    pass. If we have had the Message, we see Christ rejected. You have to belong to one of these
    organizations or you can’t get into them. So, He, He is throwed on the outside. See? CHRIST
    CAN’T WORK AMONG THEM. “What are you?” “A Christian.” “What denomination you
    belong to?” “I don’t belong to any.” “We can’t use you.” 148 See, He’s rejected. Right! See,
    rejected! So was Elijah rejected, and so was John rejected. But, what, did it hurt them? Did it
    hurt their message? They said, “Oh, you stiffnecks.” They poured it on them. They didn’t pull
    any punches. They went right ahead. AND GOD’S MESSAGE WILL MOVE RIGHT ON,
    REGARDLESS OF WHAT ANYBODY SAID, see, till the consummation, and when the…that
    which is determined shall be poured out. And we’re at the end.
    The Bible said that the head of the man is Christ and the head of the woman is the man.
    Is, that right? And so, this so-called Queen Pentecost turned down the Headship of Christ and took
    the headship of a man. All going to organize in the World Council of Churches and the so-called
    miracle revival that is coming.

    2 We got a lot of that today. It’s too bad that we have it, but we have it. Now we notice. But it
    don’t bring back the Spirit of God. Now, the thing of it is, the people are not willing to pay the
    price to get back to That. I believe that God just remains the same as He ever was. But, the thing
    of it is, the people has got so wound up into the world, and the world in them, till they just got
    just enough religion to make them miserable. Not enough to really turn loose to God and give
    your whole heart into Him, but enough, “Yeah, I go to church. Certainly, I enjoy good singing and
    clapping hands. Yeah, I love that, see.” 73 But when it comes right down to putting what you say
    you believe into practice, and willing to confess the wrong, they don’t do it. It just isn’t there.

    13
    THEY DON’T HAVE IT. Well, that’s real conviction. That’s what we need. We’ve long left that,
    a long time ago, and swapped it. Prayer, and—and confession, and conviction, we swapped it for
    emotion, a shaking, or a jerking, or a jumping up-and-down. That’s the reason there is no holding
    tight, ’cause there is nothing there to hold them, until you come upon the basis of God’s Word,
    of godly sorrow, ready to repent and make anything right, and do what’s right, ready to live right.
    I don’t care what the people say, or anything else, you live for yours, for Jesus Christ and what
    He said. Then you take a church like that, coming back, there is a possibility of it coming. BUT
    THEY’RE NOT WILLING TO DO IT.

    HAS GOT TO MAKE UP ITS MIND. EVERY MAN COMES TO A PLACE WHERE
    THERE’S A CRUCIAL HOUR. THERE WAS A CRUCIAL TIME COME WHERE YOU HAD
    TO MAKE UP YOUR MIND. A JUDGMENT SEAT, YOU WAS AT. You had to say, “I am

    CAN’T GO ON. “Why halt ye between two opinions?” said Elijah. “God be God, serve Him. If
    He’s not God, then don’t serve Him.”
    
    You remember this, Brother and Sister, the Elijah the prophet said, "They wouldn’t have
    no revival." And he said, "All that is claiming to get the Holy Ghost, is not getting the Holy
    Ghost." Because, in the 25th chapter of Matthew, the ones that had their own feast. Is, that right?
    They went out to get the oil, after they thought they already had it, they went out to get it and they
    found out that the Bridegroom had already come and the rapture had taken place. So, they did not
    get it. Why? Because they did not want to come the way of the eunuchs.

    as it was, a great place, and it was like a—a—a place where they would…a river run in the

    THEY HAD TURNED IT INTO A HOG LOT. And I was very critical of it, just saying that it
    should not be done.
    Now, what did the king do? It said, "He was... his anger was wrathful, his anger waxed
    hot and his wrath was ready to be poured out on this so-called queen."
    And that is exactly what is happening, in this hour. You are entering into an age of the
    wrath and the judgements of the living God. It is because that the queen, Pentecost and the other
    church that’s supposed to be the queen, all these churches claim to be the queen of the Lord Jesus
    Christ. They claim to be the so-called Bride but they would not come to the invitation of the
    chamberlain, the eunuch of God, the prophet. A prophet is a spiritual eunuch. He don't have any

    conditions of the lukewarm, and the indifference in the church. And how that they say that,
    “Oh, we are on the big program. We are building a million-dollar church. And our church is
    prospering. We have more members than we ever had. Our pastor is better paid. And we are
    better, altogether.” If that isn’t the call of the day! 16 But, yet, the Bible said, “Thou art naked,
    poor, miserable, blind.” 17 Just think, if a person being naked, and poor, and miserable, and
    blind, and don’t know it. Now, if he knew it, he would try to better himself. He would rush from
    the street to find clothing. He would try to better himself. But if he’s in that condition and
    doesn’t know it, what a horrible thing! Now, and in the face of all of it…That isn’t my text. 18
    Jesus said, “I stand at the door and knock. And if any man will open the door, I’ll come in to
    him, and will sup with him, and he with Me.” WHAT AN INVITATION TO A—A PEOPLE
    THAT LIVES IN THIS DAY! TO SEE THESE HORRIBLE SIGHTS THAT WE’RE NOW

    62 Look, before they could see miracles, they had to come the provided approach. Before they

    become a partaker of the glory, they had to come the provided approach to God to be a—a
    partaker of the vine—Divine approach, or the Divine articles. And before you can ever become a
    partaker of this blessed heavenly calling, you have to come through the provided approach, not
    self-sustaining, not intellectually, but death to yourself, and a reborn again in Christ Jesus
    through the offering of the Blood. Then… 63 You say, “My, why didn’t I know these things a

    your organization. You was trying to come through the auxiliary, or something another. You
    was trying to come through your own good works, through your merits. YOU’LL NEVER
    SEE IT. And you can’t approach it until you die out to those things, and come God’s provided
    way of approach, which is Jesus Christ, being filled with the Holy Spirit, God’s provided way
    for sinners to come. You’ll never be able to nurse from the Old Testament goodness and the New
    Testaments goodness. You will never be able to nurse joy, and peace, and satisfaction, and
    healing from your body. You’ll stand off and criticize, say, “Oh, it might been a long time ago,
    but I believe the approach is all dried up now.” Listen, if Christ is the approach to God, then
    God is El Shaddai. Amen. So come the provided way. Don’t try to bypass; come the provided
    way. 64 Beautiful parable, if we had time to go into it, of the wedding supper. How that the
    bridegroom give out the robes, and invited everybody. And robes made everybody look the
    same. They stood at a door. And as they come by giving their passes in the Orients and India,
    and so forth, very beautifully still carried on. They give out the robes. And everybody was
    invited, received a robe. I like that. So then… 65 When they come to the door, there was a man
    at the gate that took their invitation. They had on a robe when they come in. Come in another
    one, and another one come in. And then when they got in there, and the dinner was set, he
    found one that was there but didn’t have on the garment. WHAT HAPPENED? IT SHOWED
    HE COME IN A WINDOW, BYPASSED THE DOOR AND COME IN ANOTHER WAY. HE
    DIDN’T COME THE PROVIDED APPROACH, BECAUSE THE GATE MAN WOULD
    HAVE TURNED HIM BACK. The robe makes them all look alike. Whether you are rich or
    poor, bond or free, when the robe goes on you, you look like the others. You can’t show off fancy
    clothes and everything when you got the robe on. 66 SO THEN, IT SHOWED THAT HE COME
    IN BY A WINDOW, OR COME THE BACK DOOR, OR BYPASSED THE DOOR. JESUS
    SAID, “FRIEND, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?” AND HE WAS SPEECHLESS. See,
    God’s got an approach, and we must come that approach. And every man that comes that
    approach, dies to self, comes to Christ, regenerated, born again, filled with the Holy Spirit, the
    robe of God’s righteousness given upon you, and you live for Christ from then on. You’re
    coming God’s provided approach.
    
    So, what did the king do? He turns into a king of wrath and a king of anger and
    of judgement. And he called the eunuchs and the wise men and said, "What shall we do with this
    disobedient queen?" He said, "Let her be put away and another one, that’s faithful, be chosen.”

    65-0801M - The God Of This Evil Age
    William Marrion Branham
    But He is calling, not a church group, but “a people for His Name,” that receives His Name,
    engaged in His Name, going to a wedding to be married to Him, to become part of Him, see, by
    a predestination. Just as a man that CHOOSES A RIGHT WIFE IN LIFE, WAS ORDAINED
    TO BE PART OF HIS BODY. SO, THAT IS, THE BRIDE OF CHRIST WILL BE, AND IS
    NOW, FROM OLD, ORDAINED BY GOD TO BE A PART OF THAT BODY. See? Oh, the
    Scriptures are so rich, full of honey! 33 Notice, not what someone has said, what someone called;
    BUT WHAT GOD CHOSE BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD, AND IS
    CALLING THESE PEOPLE IN THE LAST DAYS; not an organization. “A people for His
    Name.” And this evil age is when He’s doing it, this very age of deception. 34 Last week, in
    Matthew 24, it was the most deceiving age of all ages. All the ages of deceit, from the garden of
    Eden, all the way down, there’s never been an age so deceptive as this age. “False prophets will
    rise and show signs and wonders, if possible to deceive the very Elected.” See? Now, just a cold,
    formal, starchy churches, and so forth, of man-made theology, that wouldn’t; the Elect would
    never pay no attention to that. But it’s up there almost like the real thing. Just leaving out one
    Word is all you have to do. Promised of the age; very great time! Christians, everywhere, take
    heed to the hour we’re living! Mark down, and read, and listen close. 35 WHAT WOULD GOD
    CALL A PEOPLE OUT OF THIS EVIL AGE FOR, HIS NAME? THE REASON IT IS, IS TO
    TRY HER, HIS BRIDE. IT’S TO…WHEN SHE IS MADE MANIFEST, BEEN TRIED,
    BEEN PROVEN, PROVED TO SATAN. LIKE IT WAS AT THE BEGINNING, SO SHALL IT
    BE AT THE END. 36 As a seed starts in the ground, it comes up through carriers, the life of it,
    but it ends up the same seed that it was when it went in the ground. And the same way the seed of
    deceit fell in the ground, in Eden, is the same way it ends up in the last days. Just as the Gospel
    was when it fell to a denomination at Nicaea, Rome, it ends up in a super organization. Just as the
    Seed of the Church fell back there, with the signs, wonders, and the living Christ among them,
    it ends up in the last days under the ministry of Malachi 4, and restores back again the original
    Faith that was once given. 37 We find now, THIS EVIL AGE IS TO PROVE, TO SATAN, SHE
    IS NOT LIKE EVE, THAT SHE IS NOT THAT TYPE OF A WOMAN. AND SHE WILL BE
    TRIED BY HIS WORD, THE BRIDE, AS ADAM’S BRIDE WAS TRIED BY THE WORD.
    AND ADAM’S BRIDE BELIEVED EVERY BIT OF THE WORD, ALL, BUT CONFUSED
    ON ONE PROMISE, THAT, “HE’S THE SAME YESTERDAY, TODAY, AND FOREVER,”
    TODAY, SEE; but failed on one promise, under the temptation of the enemy, face to face. AND
    NOW, THE PEOPLE THAT’S CALLED FOR HIS NAME, OF COURSE, IS HIS BRIDE. She
    is to come in contact again by the same thing; not by just denominational truth or something, BUT
    EVERY WORD! 38 For, in the beginning of the Bible, man was given the Word of God to live by.
    One Word, misinterpreted by a—a man called Satan, in a person of an animal called the serpent.
    Satan, in this person, could talk to Eve, and misinterpreted the Word to her, and was lost. See, It
    must be every Word. 39 In the middle of the Bible, Jesus come and said, “Man shall not live by
    bread alone, but by every Word,” when He was tempted by Satan. Now, God telling us here in the
    last days, that, “The god of this world will rise up in the last days.” “And whosoever shall add
    one word to It, or take one Word from It, his part will be taken from the Book of Life.” God be
    merciful to us! And let us not walk as stiff shirts, chests stuck out, head up, know it all, for we too
    one time were in disobedience. Let us with grace, and mercy, and feeling in our heart towards

    17
    God, humbly come to the Throne of grace. 40 Strange now, after some nineteen hundred years of
    Gospel preaching, and now she, that is the world system, is more evil than in the days when that,
    when He was here. The world system is more evil. The world is heading to a great climax. You
    know that. The Lord is fulfilling His Word on every hand.

    62-0318 - The Spoken Word Is The Original Seed
    William Marrion Branham
    18 The Word of promise in Himself, like It was in Mary, God Himself made manifest. He will act
    Himself, by His Own Word of promise, so to fulfill all that has been written of Him, as He did
    when He came from the virgin womb. Type of the Spirit womb now, so will the Virgin now,
    accepting His Word, “Be it unto me as Thou has said.” Though it was said by an Angel, while it
    yet was the written Word, Isaiah 9:6. 419 THEY WILL LOVE HIM, LOVE HIS, AND WILL
    HAVE HIS POTENTIALS, FOR HE IS THEIR HEAD. AND THEY ARE HIS SUBJECTS,
    SUBJECT TO HIS HEAD. HEADSHIP OF CHRIST WAS HIS. 420 NOTICE WHAT
    HARMONY! JESUS NEVER DID ANYTHING UNTIL SEEN OF THE FATHER, OR, THE
    FATHER SHOWED HIM FIRST. HARMONY BETWEEN GOD AND CHRIST, SEE, JOHN
    5:19. SO WILL THE BRIDE, AND HE SHOWS HER HIS WORD OF LIFE. HE SHOWS
    HER, AND SHE RECEIVES IT. SHE NEVER DOUBTS IT. NOTHING CAN HARM HER,
    NOT EVEN DEATH. For if the Seed be planted, the water will raise It up again. (Amen. Then I
    got a great big “Hallelujah!”) Here is the secret. THE WORD IS IN THE BRIDE, AND THE
    MIND OF CHRIST, TO KNOW WHAT HE WANTS DONE WITH THE WORD. AND SHE
    DOES IT IN HIS NAME. SHE HAS THUS SAITH THE LORD. Then It is germitized, so the
    Holy Spirit waters It until It is grown and serves Its purpose. 421 They do only His will. (Amen.
    I’ll believe that.) No one can persuade them different. They have THUS SAITH THE LORD or
    they keep still. Then they will do the works of God, for It is Himself in them continuing His
    Word to fulfill, as He did complete in His days. All things, when He was here, He did not
    complete all when He was here, for it was not time yet. 422 Now let us stand like Joshua and
    Caleb. (Now watch close. This is going to have a spiritual background.) Now let us stand like
    Joshua and Caleb, as we see the promised Land coming in sight. It’s nearing the time to be given.
    Joshua, in Hebrew, means Saviour, and represents the promised end-time leader to take the
    Church over. Caleb represents the true believer who stayed with Joshua. God started Israel as a
    virgin with His Word. But they wanted something different. So did the last-day church.
    Well, we find out the king put forth the decree to his eunuchs and said, "Go look out in all
    the land and find the virgins and bring them forth, that one might be chosen to be queen."
    Oh, blessed be the Name of the Lord God. God is choosing out a virgin, a virtuous queen,
    in this hour, to take the place of this disobedient Pentecostal queen that sold herself out for
    fanaticism and the things of the world, instead of taking the unadulterated seed of a living propheteunuch that was sent forth to call us to the Marriage Supper of the Lamb. She turned it down.

    William Marrion Branham
    20 Now anyone knows, that any time that God sends a gift to the earth, and the people turns
    that gift down, it’s always chaos to that nation and that people, that turns down the gift of
    God. Jesus was the greatest Gift God ever give to the world. And the Jewish people turned it
    down, and is scattered throughout the world from that time since. And when God sends a gift,
    and the people refuses to see it, and refuses to take it, then it’s scattered, the people is, and
    they—like sheep having no shepherd.
    And so, Christ is sending forth His eunuchs, in this hour, to bring forth a Bride. It’s
    beautiful. These eunuchs, in this hour of the Lord Jesus Christ, they are eunuchs that have no seed
    of their own to plant. That’s just beautiful. Now, when the eunuchs sent forth into all the land to
    gather the virgins, ... You know there was five... five virgins that were foolish and five were
    wise. Is, that right?
    Matthew 25:1-9-Reference quote
    1 Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and
    went forth to meet the bridegroom.
    2 And five of them were wise, and five were foolish.
    3 They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:
    4 But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.
    5 While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.
    6 And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him.
    7 Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.
    8 And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out.
    9 But the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye
    rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.
    So, there was a virgin found among all of these other virgins that was fair and pleasing to
    the king because she had the virtues that the king was looking for. She would be obedient to the
    word of the king. And this one that they found was named “Esther”. And Esther was given into the
    hands of God's eunuchs—the king's eunuchs, Esther was given into the hands of the Lord Jesus
    Christ’s eunuchs, spiritual eunuchs in this last Church Age. Oh, it’s just beautiful.

    63-0116 - The Evening Messenger
    William Marrion Branham
    243 God has always counted character, not members. And today we do vice versa. We count
    members, good dress, well payers, instead of character. Uh-huh. 244 Eliezer sweated it out,
    until he found character. That’s right. Who would he get? And he trusted God. Character for

    19
    what? Character for Isaac, the bride, which the Church is type of. You know that. That was the
    natural seed of Abraham; this is the royal Seed of Abraham. Well, if Eliezer, the messenger
    hunting the bride and trying to find character, if that man is come, a messenger of the last
    day, TRYING TO FIND THE BRIDE FOR CHRIST, he will not look for a denominational
    membership. He will look for character that’s willing. 245 Watch! Good character first, then to
    get her ready to meet Isaac. After he found the character, THEN GET HER STAND STILL
    LONG ENOUGH TO LISTEN TO HIS MESSAGE of Isaac. 246 That’s the messenger of the
    last days, the evening Light, is first find that Church (WHERE WILL THEY BELIEVE THE
    MESSAGE?), hunt it. Can you read what I’m talking about? Hunt where that Church is that’ll
    even let you come in, that won’t close the door in your face. And then when you do there, then
    you’ve found character. Now if she will stand still long enough to tell her how that Bride’s got
    to be dressed! She’s got to be clothed. Stand still! If she could get… 247 Look at the little
    Rebekah listening to every word, her little heart was beating. She…He—he was telling her. Now,
    you’ve sweated it out, “Where will I go?” until I find the character. Then when I find the
    character, then make her stand still long enough to get her ready to go to meet him. Oh, my,
    what a striking thing! (Wish we had a little more time on that clock.) Get her ready; stand still to
    listen to his message of him. Eliezer wasn’t speaking of hisself, but he was speaking of the one
    he was sent from. And he had the gifts to prove that he was sent from him. Amen! He wanted to
    clothe her with these things. You know how he fixed her up. 248 If I could just get her to wash
    her face! See? You know, I—I just felt checked on that, so I better keep still. Anyhow, I’ve said
    enough, you know what I’m talking about. All right, listen, just stand still. 249 NOTICE, THE
    END-TIME MESSENGER, HIS JOB WILL BE TO GET THE SAINTS READY, THE
    BRIDE READY FOR THE BRIDEGROOM. THAT WILL BE HIS MESSAGE. Now you
    want to learn ABC’s so you can study algebra later? When these other SEALS ON THE BACK
    IS OPENED THEY’LL ONLY BE REVEALED TO THEM. That’s right. Learn ABC first.
    What is ABC? “Always Believe Christ,” (not your creed), Christ. See? Believe what He says, not
    what somebody else says. 250 If it’s contrary, if a man tells you, “It’s all right for you to cut
    your hair, women,” you know he’s lying. The Bible says it’s wrong. If he says, “You can be
    deacon and still have four or five wives,” he’s lying. That’s contrary to the Word. See? All these
    other things that we speak of, call it to the Word and see if it’s the Word right. 251 Bring back
    the church to the Word. Now, what is this messenger of Malachi 4 to do? Restore back the
    original Faith, the resurrection Faith. That, they seen Jesus after He had raised from the dead,
    seen Him working among them. 252 They were men of few words. They went forth and preached
    the Word. Oh, they preached long, Paul preached all night one time. See? A man fell out of the
    building, killed himself. He laid his body over him, brought him back to life again, see. See? See,
    kept on preaching. 253 Now, notice they were different man than what the Ph., L.L., Q.U.S.T.,
    and ever what you want to call it, is today. What? Separates the messenger and…The Message,
    rather, by the messenger, will separate the believers from unbelievers. Some of them will line to
    It, and some won’t. Some of the Lutheran… Some of the Catholic lined to Luther, some didn’t.
    Some of the Lutherans lined to Methodist, some didn’t. Some lines to Pentecost, and some won’t.
    Some will line with the evening Light, some won’t. 254 How you going to know whether it’s
    evening Light or not? Test it with the Word (not just one Word, ALL THE WORD PUT
    TOGETHER), see whether it’s right or not. Oh, what is it in? Then if this Message bears forth
    the vindication of God performing what He said He would do, AND IT’S LINED WITH THE
    WORD, THEN THE WORD IS VINDICATED LIKE OTHER TIMES AND OTHER
    PROPHETICS DID. 255 Notice when the Message…when…Notice when the Message is

    20
    rejected by the people, and the messenger SEEMS to be completely defeated, he can’t get
    another door, he can’t get a place.
    Now, these eunuchs of this king gave Esther everything that she needed for her
    purification of her body. And she, after the manner of the queen that was given to the king, she
    was to purify her body six months with the oil of myrrh and for six more months she was to bathe
    her body in other sweet-smelling perfumes for the purification of her body. Oh, that’s beautiful.
    And the Bible said that the Bride hath made herself ready. She hath prepared her body for
    the marriage of the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords. And there is only one type of minister
    that the Lord Jesus Christ is letting minister to His queen, in this hour, and that is a spiritual
    eunuch because he could not trust any of these other so-called ministers of this hour to be in the
    bed chamber of his queen.
    Revelation 19:7-9-Reference quote:
    7 Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour to him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come,
    and his wife hath made herself ready.
    8 And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white: for the
    fine linen is the righteousness of saints.
    9 And he saith unto me, Write, Blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of
    the Lamb. And he saith unto me, These are the true sayings of God
    
    Now, I want you to know that these eunuchs were right in the bed chamber with the
    queen. They were right in her quarters and cared for her every need. And the eunuchs presented
    Esther with everything that she needed to prepare her body for the marriage of the
    King. Beautiful, I just love this. Now, the king couldn’t trust any other men with his queen
    because for fear that while that they were in his queen's bed chamber, that they would plant their
    own seed in the queen. Aha now, if you’re spiritual, you’ll get it.

    And there’s only two resources that spirits can come from: that’s either from God or the devil.
    There’s no halfway between them. There’s no halfway Christian. Did you ever see a drunk sober
    man? Did you ever see a black white bird? You never seen a sinner saint. You’re either a
    Christian or you’re a sinner. That’s what I like about you full Gospel people: you put the line
    down, and you’re—you’re on one side or the other. If you’re borned again… If I’m borned a
    human, I’m a human. When you’re born a Christian, you’re a Christian. 23 Now, that germ, let
    me just take this a little farther. Do you realize that you came from one little germ? Is that right?
    Now, it’s…?… You came from one germ. There was a time when you wasn’t nothing. Sir, you
    setting here, you there, any of you, myself, was one little germ. Well, the—the germ of life comes
    from the male sex. We know that. Here, for instance, we can have a… Well, just like spring. Birds
    make their nests, and they lay their eggs. An old mother bird could make her nest and lay it full of
    eggs. And she could lay that nest full of eggs without being with the male bird too. And she could

    21
    get on them, and warm those eggs, and hover them, and stay there till she got so poor, till she
    couldn’t get off the nest. And not one of those eggs would hatch. They would lay right there and
    rot in the nest (Is that right?), because they haven’t been with the mate. She hasn’t been with the
    male bird; and therefore, they’re not fertile. That reminds me a whole lot of these old cold
    formal churches. You just hug them around, and twist them around, and try to pat them into the
    church, a nest full of rotten eggs, ’cause they haven’t been with the Male, Christ Jesus. They’re
    not believers in the first place. That’s right. 24 What we need today is a good old fashion
    cleaning out, and getting right with God. That’s exactly right. TO BRING—TO BRING IT
    BACK—PEOPLE BACK TO A LIVING FAITH in God, there to say it’s right or it’s wrong.
    God grant the day when men and women will be what they claim to be. That’s right. It’s… Now,
    notice. But when the—the male… See, God foreordained that. That’s the way with… We reason
    we believe that Jesus was of a virgin birth. You hear a lot in the full Gospel churches argue
    concerning that. Look, I believe that Mary was a virgin. She knew nothing about any man. But
    JEHOVAH GOD OVERSHADOWED HER, AND CREATED IN HER WOMB A BLOOD
    CELL, WHICH WAS BY HIMSELF A CREATED POWER. AND FROM THAT BLOOD
    CELL CAME THE MAN CHRIST JESUS. AND HE WAS THE BLOOD OF HIS FATHER
    BY A VIRGIN BIRTH. And it’s… That’s the Blood that I’m preaching about tonight, that both
    saves and heals, that unadulterated Blood of the Son of God. And friends, IF YOU DON’T
    BELIEVE THAT, THEN YOU CAN’T BE SAVED. No other way, but through the Blood of
    Jesus Christ which is the Blood of His Father God, unadulterated, no—no sex mixed into it at
    all. IT WAS A CREATED BIRTH. You believe that? That’s the true Gospel, friends.

    133 THEN LET THE MALE, CHRIST JESUS, OUR LOVER, WITH HIS SEED IN YOUR
    HEART, HE COMES TO HIS SEED TO MAKE IT ALIVE. “THE WORD, THE LETTER,
    KILLETH. THE SPIRIT GIVETH LIFE.” The letter, alone, kills. But when the Holy Spirit
    comes down through the cleansing Blood, into this womb, a germ takes on. 134 What is it by a
    mother? The little egg lays there, the little seed, lays there waiting for the male. And as soon as
    the male germ comes, the male germ rushes quick. And what is it? A BLOOD CELL. IT
    OPENS ITSELF. (O God, can you hear and understand what I mean, God?) Then it opens itself,
    and around this forms a little pocket of blood. On the inside of this, puts this little egg to life. And,

    22
    in there, begins to come forth. In there, brings life. We are conceived by the Holy Ghost. The
    Spirit of God comes into our hearts, brings a new Person, Christ Jesus. Old things die. 135 And
    if you reject to hear It, and just keep, “Well, my preacher said this, that, or the other,” and YOU
    REFUSE TO HAVE LIFE, YOU BECOME STERILE. Then he…You come to a place where
    you can’t have no more children. You are sterile. You’re in reproach. You can’t have children.
    And if you grieve the Spirit of God too many times, you are sealed, you don’t hear It no more. 136
    First time you heard It, oh, my, you let your hair grow out; you act like ladies; you didn’t wear
    these things; you act like a lady. You act like a man; you kept your house in order. You done those
    things. But then, all at once, it begin to move around. What was it? You never let the Life come in
    and go to work. You died, prematurely. That’s right. 137 NOW LET THE SPIRIT OF GOD
    COME IN, COME THROUGH THE HEARING OF THE WORD. You heard It; that’s the
    Bible. If you receive the mark of the beast, you’re lost forever. If you receive the Seal of God,
    you’re sealed forever. And there’s the two spirits that’s working.
    And that is exactly why, in this hour, that God has only called one kind of a minister to
    prepare the Body of the Lord Jesus Christ, the Bride for the Marriage Supper of the Lamb. And
    that is his spiritual eunuchs that have no other seed than the seed which the prophet
    and messenger planted in their hearts, in this end time. They are spiritual eunuchs and they only
    plant the seed of a prophet-messenger to prepare the Body of the Lord Jesus… of the Bride of the
    Lord Jesus Christ, that he might have a Bride to rapture, the unadulterated Word.
    The King wants to plant his own seed in the Bride. He don't want some other preacher to
    plant his own creed or dogma. Amen? He don't want some other preacher planting their own seed
    in his Bride. AND HOW MANY PREACHERS, OUT HERE, THAT CLAIM TO BE
    PREPARING A BRIDE FOR THE LORD JESUS CHRIST AND THEY’RE PLANTING THEIR
    OWN SEED? Amen. They say, "I don't believe the seed of the serpent." But the Bible teaches
    it. And then they try to prepare a Bride and say, "There is no such thing as seed of the serpent."

    VERY MANIFESTATION OF THE WORD OF THE LIVING GOD. Denominations cannot
    produce this (wrong seed). They will produce their creeds and their dogmas, mixed with the
    Word. This mongrelizing brings forth a hybrid product. The first son (Adam) was the spoken
    seed-Word of God. HE WAS GIVEN A BRIDE TO REPRODUCE HIMSELF. THAT IS WHY
    THE BRIDE WAS GIVEN TO HIM, TO REPRODUCE HIMSELF; TO PRODUCE
    ANOTHER SON OF GOD. But she fell. She fell by hybridization. She caused him to die. THE
    SECOND SON (JESUS), ALSO A SPOKEN SEED-WORD OF GOD WAS GIVEN A BRIDE

    23
    LIKE AS WAS ADAM. But before He could marry her, she also had fallen. She, like Adam’s
    wife, was put to the test whether she would believe the Word of God and live, or doubt the Word
    and die. She doubted. She left the Word. She died. From a little group of the true seed of the
    Word, God will present Christ with a beloved bride. She is a virgin of His Word. She is a virgin
    because she knows no man-made creeds or dogmas. By and through the members of the bride
    will be fulfilled all that was promised of God to be made manifest in the virgin. The word of
    promise came to the virgin Mary. But that Word of promise was He, Himself, to be made
    manifest. God was made manifest. He, Himself, acted at that time and fulfilled His own Word of
    promise in the virgin. It was an angel that had brought her the message. But the angel’s
    message was the Word of God. Isaiah 9:6. He fulfilled at that time all that was written of Him
    because she accepted His Word to her. The members of the virgin bride will love Him, and they
    will have His potentials, for He is their head, and all power belongs to Him. They are subject to
    Him as the members of our bodies are subject to our heads. Notice the harmony of the Father and
    the Son. Jesus never did anything until it was first showed Him by the Father. John 5:19. This
    harmony is now to exist between the Groom and His bride. He shows her His Word of life. She
    receives it. She never doubts it. Therefore, nothing can harm her, not even death. For if the
    seed be planted, the water will raise it up again. Here is the secret of this. The Word is in the
    bride (as it was in Mary). The bride has the mind of Christ for she knows what He wants done
    with the Word. She performs the command of the Word in His name for she has “thus saith the
    Lord.” Then the Word is quickened by the Spirit and it comes to pass. Like a seed that is planted
    and watered, it comes to full harvest, serving its purpose. Those in the bride do only His will. No
    one can make them do otherwise. They have “thus saith the Lord” or they keep still. They know
    that it has to be God in them doing the works, fulfilling His own Word. He did not complete all
    His work while in His earthly ministry so now He works in and through the bride. She knows
    that, for it was not yet time for Him to do certain things that He must now do. But He will now
    fulfill through the bride that work which He left for this specific time.

    73 He still has the Seed, Christ is his Son according to the flesh. There one sets there. “David
    shall not fail.” That’s right. And Christ is that “Lion of the tribe of Juda” from which David
    sprang from. 74 Now, we find out that they were the guards to the mercy seat. They watched the
    mercy seat.
    I want to tell you, tonight, I will challenge any man in this room, tonight, to prove to me
    that there is no seed of the serpent. I’ll prove it to you, there are. The Bible said that the serpent
    had a seed. And the Bible said that Enoch was the seventh from Adam and Cain was not in there.
    Jude 1:14-Reference quote:
    14 And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord
    cometh with ten thousands of his saints,

    24
    So, that ends it. And the Bible said, “…and Cain, who was of his father the wicked
    one. And the wicked one was the devil. And the devil incarnated himself in the beast and got to
    the first queen of God.
    1 John 3:12-Reference quote:
    12 Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him?
    Because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous.

    262 Now, oh, man, here we are! Blessed be the Lord! Now we come to the Body to be the Bride of
    Christ, now to be His “flesh of His flesh, and bone of His bone.” Now, we’ll hurry up now. “Flesh
    of His flesh, and bone of His bone.” Why didn’t… 263 Ask you a question. Why didn’t all your
    rains, back yonder, bring the bride to Christ? I want you to answer me that. If…His Coming is
    overdue. We believe it. (Like it was in the days of Noah, longsuffering, He’s getting His Bride
    ready.) Why didn’t these rains…Why didn’t you Pentecostals back yonder, a few years ago, when
    you started, forty, fifty years ago, why didn’t you bring Christ, the Bridegroom, to the bride?
    Going to let that soak, a minute. Why? Because you pregnated her, yourself, with your
    denomination. That’s exactly what you done. HE WON’T MARRY A WHORE. HE’LL
    MARRY A VIRGIN. IT’S FLAT, BUT THAT’S THE TRUTH. YOU KNOW IT, IN A FLAT
    WAY. You don’t have to wonder. I don’t stumble around about It. TELL YOU THE TRUTH.
    WHY DIDN’T IT BRING HER? WHY DIDN’T IT BRING CHRIST, BRING CHRIST TO
    HER? BECAUSE SHE’S NOT FIT. HE FOUND HER IN ADULTERY. 264 EXACTLY THE
    REASON CHILDREN DON’T LIVE FOREVER WHEN THEY’RE BORN; ADAM FOUND
    HIS WIFE PREGNATED. 265 THAT’S THE REASON JEHOVAH HAD TO TAKE A
    GENTILE BRIDE; FOUND HER PREGNATED. 266 THAT’S EXACTLY THE WAY
    CHRIST HAS TO GET HIM A BRIDE NOW; HE’S FOUND THE SO-CALLED GROUP
    PREGNATED. HE’S GOING TO SOW HIS SEED. SOMEBODY IS GOING TO GET IT,
    BECAUSE THEY’RE PREDESTINATED TO BE A CHURCH AT THE END OF THE
    ROAD. 267 Like Adam and Jehovah’s, He found them pregnated with man-made doctrines of
    denominations. Like God’s Truth, in Genesis 1, “Every seed has brought forth after its kind.” So,
    when the Spirit fell on her, man had been there to her womb, and filled it with denominational
    seeds of his own thinking, so that’s why she got to be the way she is, AND CHRIST COULD
    NOT COME TO HER. Hum! That’s hard, isn’t it?
    And that is exactly why that the Lord Jesus Christ is not permitting any kind of a
    minister, outside of a spiritual eunuch, to minister to the things of the Body of the Lord Jesus
    Christ. They are giving her everything that she needs to prepare herself for the Marriage Supper of

    25
    the Lamb. Praise God. The Bible said, "You don't cut your hair," that is exactly what he is
    preparing your Body for. If the Bible said, "Seed of the serpent," that is exactly what he prepares
    the Bride with. If the Bible said, "Repent and be baptized in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ,"
    that is exactly how he prepares the Body. Anything that God said, he puts the period behind it and
    says, "Amen."
    And it’s only the spiritual eunuch that will plant the Seed of the King because he don't
    have any seed of his own. He don't have any will of his own. That’s why he could be obedient to
    the King of Kings and Lord of Lords because he don't have any will. He lost his will and he only
    plants the Seed of the King. I just love that.
    And that’s what God is doing in this hour. He had called the spiritual eunuchs to give
    Esther all the perfumes and the oils that she needs to prepare her body for this great message. Oh,
    blessed be the Name of the Lord.
    I praise God that he has got some spiritual eunuchs on the scene. After the great eunuch
    and messenger left, God still has eunuchs to go on and put the finishing touches of perfection on
    the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ. And she will be perfected. And there is a ministry here now,
    that is perfecting the Bride but it is unseen. But the Bride is being perfected day by day and she is
    preparing her body for the great marriage of the Lamb.

    225 Oh, how that would do for a real Christian, to get away from the things of the world. And
    someday, you talk about coming into the port, on the wings of a Dove! He’s coming for a Bride,
    one that don’t fool with the world or the things of the world. She is washed in the Blood of the
    Lamb. She’s pledged Her—Her love to Him only. The love of the world is gone and dead to
    Her. “The marriage of the Lamb has come, and His Bride has made Herself ready.” Let’s
    think of it while we bow our heads just a moment. 226 Some day, as I look towards the setting of
    the sun, I too, thirty-one years ago, made a pledge to One that I loved, all my love to Him. I’ve
    always tried to hold up for Him and His Word, wherever I go. I know there’s many others setting
    in here, like that, waiting for the day that when the old ship of Zion shall come into the port, pick
    up our souls and take us in the Presence of Him Who we love and has pledged our love to. 227
    There may be some in here tonight, who has never made that pledge. There may be some that’s
    made it and broke it. If you’re in that condition tonight, friend, why don’t you just come back
    tonight and renew your pledge? If you haven’t, make it. Why don’t you come and make it
    tonight? Say, “Lord Jesus, I love You.” 228 Remember, if you have already made your pledge,
    and still mingling with the things of the world, Jesus will not have a bride like that. He will not
    have one that’s adulterous. All your love must be to Him. And if you love the things of the
    world, and the fashions of this world, better than you love God, then you have not made
    yourself ready.

    62-1111M - Dedication
    William Marrion Branham
    48 Now, if you notice, Solomon never varied one bit from the pattern that Moses saw on Mount
    Sinai, in Heaven. Moses, when he returned from his vision, pitched the tent, and made it just
    exactly like he saw in Heaven. And when Solomon built the temple, he made it just exactly the
    way he—he seen the pattern, the type. Moses pitched the tent, for a—a perpetual type, because it
    was moved from place to place. But, Solomon, he made the—the tabernacle just exactly in the
    fashion that Moses had seen in Heaven. It was all put together, set in order, just exactly. 49 What
    a spiritual application we could apply here: that we are never to leave the Scripture. Stay exactly
    with the pattern. That’s the reason, I believe, that the way the first Church was patterned, that’s
    the way the next One should be patterned, that’s the way every one should be patterned, just the
    way it was at the beginning. And I believe that God has it that way, I believe, the real Church.
    All right. 50 The materials, cut out in their native land, brought into one place. But when they
    were brought together…I’m reading now from the 16th chapter, or quoting from it. Now, when
    they were brought together, they were so perfectly fit, that, in the space of forty years that it
    taken to put the construction up, there wasn’t one—one stone to be re-sawed. There wasn’t a
    buzz of a saw, or a sound of a hammer, for forty years. Talk about masonry, architecture! 51
    Now, that showed, that, when we are doing anything, and doing it in the pattern that God has set
    for us… 52 Now, many of those stones looked very odd. But there was a place in the temple for
    every odd, peculiar stone. God had a place for them. 53 Our ministries, which is a beautiful
    type there, or an antitype to it, shows that, in our peculiarity, our way of worship. Yet, when the
    Temple, the real Temple that we will come to after a few minutes, comes together, there will be a
    place for every odd-acting person. We may look a little funny to someone else, and act a little
    funny; but, remember, it’s the place there for us. God is cutting out His Church. 54 And every
    little stone had its place fit exactly to it. And remember, it was cut, away from the place it
    would be put together at; but, when it come together, it didn’t even need even honing. It was
    already honed. God had made it so it fit perfectly into its place. 55 Oh, what a type there we
    find, of the spiritual, how that every gift of God, every odd act of born-again Christians, in
    their peculiarity, yet it’s got its place. It fits in the Body. It goes to its right place. 56 And many
    of us would—would try to say, “Now, that’s not of God,” a good, holy, consecrated soldier of the
    cross. And we say, “Now, we stood in church the other night, and we heard such-and-such a
    thing. That can’t be of God.” But if it’s in line with the Pattern, if it’s in a line with the Scripture,
    it may be odd, but it’s going to have its place. See? It’ll fit right in, and it won’t even need
    honing or polishing. It’ll go to its place, for the great Architect, Christ, is preparing it now;
    odd, one to the other. 57 Now we notice, in the building down here, the next chapter, that, in
    this building, there was one stone that was actually too odd to fool with, so the builders
    rejected it. So they just pitched it over into the corner, said, “That stone is actually too odd to
    be used. There’s no such a place.” 58 Now, remember, it was the builders who should have
    knowed different. Jesus spoke of it. 59 BUT, COME TO FIND OUT, THEY HAD BUILT THE
    BUILDING SO HIGH UNTIL THEY MISSED THE STONE. AND THEY DIDN’T KNOW
    WHERE THAT STONE WAS. They might have searched all the ships. They might have run
    through every ox cart. They might have sent messengers up into Joppa, and down, say, “Has
    another load come in?” Or, “Did you lose one on the road? There’s something wrong. We just
    can’t find that stone for this place.” And when they could not find it, nowhere else, come to find

    27
    out, it was right on the ground. IT WAS THE CHIEF CORNERSTONE THAT THE
    BUILDERS REJECTED. 60 Jesus spoke of it, and said, “HAVE NOT YOU READ OF THE
    STONE THAT THE BUILDERS REJECTED? WAS THE CHIEF CORNERSTONE, THE
    HEAD OF ALL OF IT, WHERE THE REST OF THE BUILDING RESTED UPON IT.”
    Oh, how wonderful it is to see that first spiritual Eunuch that came, the Lord Jesus
    Christ. How He planted only the Seed of His Heavenly Father. He did not have any seed of his
    own to plant. He said, "I only do those things as my Heavenly Father shows Me first. My
    Heavenly Father worketh hitherto and I work.
    John 5:17-Reference quote:
    17 But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.
    I always do those things which please my Heavenly Father."
    John 8:28-29-Reference quote:
    28 Then said Jesus unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I
    am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things.
    29 And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those
    things that please him.
    Is, that right? And he didn’t have any seed of his own to plant, so therefore, God could
    trust the eunuchs, in this hour, because they have no seed to impregnate the Bride with.
    Listen, the Bible said that Jesus Christ was coming after a Bride without spot, wrinkle or
    blemish.
    Ephesians 5:26-27-Reference quote:
    26 That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word,
    27 That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any
    such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.
    And over in Jude It said, "These spots and wrinkles and blemishes are false prophets and
    false teachers that are feasting right among you."
    Jude 1:10-12-Reference quotes
    10 But these speak evil of those things which they know not: but what they know naturally, as
    brute beasts, in those things they corrupt themselves.
    11 Woe unto them! for they have gone in the way of Cain, and ran greedily after the error of
    Balaam for reward, and perished in the gainsaying of Core.
    12 These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves
    without fear: clouds they are without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit withereth,
    without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;

    Jude 1:16-19-Reference quotes:
    16 These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own lusts; and their mouth speaketh
    great swelling words, having men's persons in admiration because of advantage.
    17 But, beloved, remember ye the words which were spoken before of the apostles of our Lord
    Jesus Christ;
    18 How that they told you there should be mockers in the last time, who should walk after their
    own ungodly lusts.
    19 These be they who separate themselves, sensual, having not the Spirit.
    But I want you to know, tonight, that Jesus Christ is not coming after anything that is not
    one hundred percent Word-born Bride.

    holy and without blame before him in love:

    to the good pleasure of his will,
    Said, "All He called, He justified and all He justified, he hath already glorified." And it
    said, "He has predestinated many sons to be conformed into the image of the Lord Jesus Christ,

    MANIFESTATION OF THE WORD OF THE LIVING GOD.
    
    Jesus Christ only had one will and that was the will of his Heavenly Father. And he
    carried out that will from the time that he was born until the time that he was crucified.
    Oh, can you see all of this so-called preachers, out here in this hour, that are supposed to
    be a getting a Bride ready for the Lord Jesus Christ and letting the people do anything they want
    to. “Oh, it is all right to cut your hair. The Lord don't care. He loves...” “It is all right to marry
    two or three different times because God loves you. God loves you.” “Oh, it is all right to wear a
    little bit of make-up. It is all right to do all these things.” “Oh, it don't make no difference how
    you’re baptized.” It did in the first church. Paul, that great spiritual eunuch, said, "If an angel
    would come from heaven and preach any other gospel than what I preach to you, let him be
    accursed." And that is a spiritual eunuch, in this hour.

    The serpent was a man. The blood of an animal won’t mix with the blood of a human. No, sir.
    But this specie was so close, between there, till he did mix, and Satan knew that. Great giant of a
    fellow! Isn’t it strange that they found great giants in the land after this? I wish Josephus, the
    writer, would have thought of that. Where’d those giants come from? The seed of the serpent.
    The Bible said that he would—he would cause the seed of the serpent… “The seed of the
    serpent,” the serpent had a seed, “and the seed of the woman.” But we better leave them alone.
    They don’t believe it, so we just take them on their baby form. But when she did that, she polluted
    the whole thing. 101 Now don’t get it to that ridiculous thing, please, of an apple tree. As I’ve
    often said: if eating apples caused women to realize they were naked, they had better pass the
    apples again, ’cause it—it’s time. I don’t say that to be rude. But I’m saying it, to—to make a
    point, that it’s the truth. Wasn’t apples. Let’s not get that ridiculous about it. It wasn’t no apple
    tree. 102 But let’s take it on another tree, so we can bring it out and fulfill our text. Let’s take it,
    a tree of faith, that Eve taken of this forbidden tree of unbelief. Then we can make the text come
    out. It was faith. She disbelieved God’s Word. God said a certain-certain thing will happen; she
    ought to have let It alone. She ought to have believed It the way God said It. But, no, Satan
    come along with his theology, and she mixed it, and gave it to Adam, and it caused a hybrid

    102 Now to go back in Genesis, which is the beginning. Genesis means “the beginning.” We find
    that God gave His family Eternal Life as long as they stayed in this Word and lived by this Word.
    But when they broke it, just one link in the chain of promises, death struck them, which was a
    promise also. 103 It’s a chain. You’re hanging over hell with it, and that’s the only thing
    that’ll carry you through. When the believer becomes a make-believer and lives on one word
    that’s contrary to this Word, he cuts his fellowship with God. One link broke! And, remember,
    your faith in this Word is like a chain. A chain is its strongest at its weakest link. That’s right.
    It’s the strongest, that, ’cause that’s all it’ll hold. And if there is something in the Word that’s
    puzzling to you, something that you have heard different, but they said, “Thee? Oh, that was for
    the apostles, and them things was for days gone by,” when the Scripture said Jesus Christ is the
    same yesterday, today and forever, don’t let that be a weakness! Fortify It and hold It, and wrap
    your life into It, because that’s the only thing that’ll take you over the flames of hell. That’s right.
    104 When this chain is broke, with Adam and Eve, the first family, now remember, they didn’t
    break a sentence, they didn’t break three Words; one Word! Man shall hang over hell by every
    Word, every Word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God. That’s where man’s Eternal
    destination is determined. Why, he’ll hang by that chain, or he’ll hang by a creed; or if there
    is creed mixed into the chain, there is where the weak link is, and you’re gone. That’s where
    the weak link was with Adam and with Eve. That weak link, “surely,” he said, “God…” But
    surely God said it! And if God said it, God meant it. And He also keeps His Word by saying,
    “The day you eat thereof, that day you die.” The day you put into you anything else besides the
    unadulterated Word of God, into your soul, that’s the day that you’re separated from God. 105
    Now this is very strong, but just listen close. Now notice. One Word, one Word of the first of the
    Bible, God said that, “One Word, separated man from its Eternal Life Chain.” 106 That’s like
    taking a man and you hang him, by his feet…he’s got his hands in Heaven, and you cut him half
    in two, break off a toe, whatever you’re hanging unto. You’re hanging on the very bottom part,
    and, you break that chain, anywhere, you’re gone. Now bear that in mind.

    18 And every penny that’s left from our meetings (Brother Lindsay and them knows just what we
    eat, and so forth) we turn right straight back into the Gospel work, back, and try to live just as
    cheap as I can. When I go to the cities, I don’t look for big hotels. The cheapest one I can find,
    that’s what I want. See? I want to be just as poor as everyone that comes to me to be prayed for.
    That’s right. If I’d accepted the money that’s offered me, I’d be a multimillionaire. I had one
    man out of California, after his wife had a cancer of the breast, they had to fly quickly because
    they thought she was dying. And when that cancer left her, the window curtain rolled up tight
    like that before hundreds of those Armenians and let down like that. And the demon power left
    the woman, and the doctor said she couldn’t live till morning. And now she’s a well woman
    today, walking around. And that man owned that—part of that big Mission Bell Winery, and
    things, and sent me a—a—a check, bank draft for a million, five hundred thousand dollars. And I
    refused to put my hands on it and look at it. The Baxters had brought it to me. I said, “No, sir, I
    don’t want to see it.” Said, “Well, Reverend Branham, it was sent to you.” I said, “I do not want
    to see it. I don’t want nothing to do with money.” When a man gets his mind on money, he loses
    God. That’s right. And that’s—that’s right. [Audience applauds—Ed.] Thank you. You can’t
    keep your mind on… You got to be… 19 Here’s three things that I’ve noticed in reading of
    other ministers. If this ever gets a hold of a minister, it’s got him. And there’s a weak spot:
    money, women, popularity. That’s right. Dodge the very appearance of it. That’s right. For
    money, I care not for it. I’ve got a little old fat wife here, that I think’s the sweetest woman in the
    world. That’s right. That’s right. She’s the only one I’ve ever cared for, right, and some little
    children. When I was a sinner I lived clean, and when I’m a Christian. And for popularity, who
    am I? Six foot of dirt, that’s all: sinner saved by grace. And it wasn’t for God, where would I be?
    So I… We’re nothing. That’s right. And we’re… And you pray for me. [Audience applauds—Ed.]

    you are filled with the Holy Ghost this morning, and God’s power is moving in every fiber of

    You let down the bars (That’s what it is.), let down on the Word. We’re getting stiff and
    starchy, afraid to come back to the old fashion Gospel (That’s right), to the old salvation that
    makes you clean up, fix up (That’s right), make right and come before God. 25 That’s what’s
    the matter with the church today. We need a revival. We don’t need a new seminary. We don’t
    need new preachers. We don’t need new church buildings. We need a revival in what we got.
    That’s what it is. Stirring up… Amen. All right. I’m not amening myself, but “Amen” means “so
    be it.” And I believe it with all my heart. That’s what the world needs today is an old fashion,
    God sent, sky-blue, sin-killing religion, old Saint Paul’s revival, and the Bible Holy Ghost
    back into the church again. That might be pretty strong for a Baptist, but that’s right. True. I’m
    a Pentecostal Baptist. I got the Holy Ghost since I’ve been a Baptist. That’s right. Notice, Cleans
    up, sets aside. Makes a different person, new creature in Christ Jesus. All right. Here’s what we
    need. 26 Then he doubted it to be so. BUT GOD’S GOING TO CONFIRM HIS WORD.
    DON’T YOU WORRY. “God’s able of these stones to rise children to Abraham,” said John.
    Watch. Then in all of that, what taken place? God was sure to bring it to pass, ’cause it was at
    the season, at the time. His Words, every cog must fit the same place; when them prophetic
    wheels begin to roll together, it’s got to happen. And there’s coming a time when there’s…
    Right now, in the near future, that when great judgment’s going to be upon these nations that
    forget God. When you put up with what I’ve seen the last few days, and see around in this
    country under the name of religion, and living the way people’s living, no wonder communistic
    things break out, and things the way they are. [Blank spot on tape—Ed.]…?… that the Bible

    253 Jesus did the works of His Father because the Father was in Him. That is why the works was
    done, because that the Father was in the Son. Do you believe that? [Congregation says,
    “Amen.”—Ed.] That, in Him, He was the incarnate God. Do you believe that? [“Amen.”] That,
    God the Father, which is the Father of Jesus Christ, the Great Spirit dwelt (in the fulness of His
    Power) in Jesus Christ, which was the Tabernacle of God, made flesh and dwelt on earth,
    representing the Word. Jesus was the Word. The Bible said so, Saint John, 1st chapter. And the
    Word was invisible. Now listen close. The Word was invisible until It was made flesh, and then
    the Word become visible. 254 And through His sacrificial death at Calvary, and His
    resurrection, positionally placed His Church in that realm, that the same invisible God could
    come into the individual and make the Word visible. Oh, my! I—I wish my church could get that.
    If you could see, friends, the invisible God made visible! Now listen. Let’s study it again now.
    255 I’ve often wanted to come into a church, I’ve longed to see it, I guess, where I could walk
    in the back door, front door, wherever it was, look across an audience and see a perfect
    church, all in order. Sin couldn’t stay there; no, the Spirit call it out, you see. It just couldn’t
    stay. Like Ananias and Sapphira, you—you just couldn’t do it. There’ll be no sin in that—that
    group. No, sir. See, the Spirit quickly speak it like that. [Brother Branham quickly snaps his
    finger four times—Ed.] No matter what it was, how little, it would be done. See women and
    men sitting there under the Power of the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of God moving perfectly,
    moving this. Someone had done something wrong in the congregation, couldn’t, they’d
    be…They couldn’t, it’d…They come quickly, confess it before them. The Spirit got a hold of it,
    to confess it, both. They come, tell it, ’cause they know right then it’s going to be called. That’s
    right. That’s the Church of the living God. How my old, poor old heart, now it’s getting old,
    how I’ve longed to stand and see a church like that. I may, yet. I hope to. Perfect works of
    God, without sin, now, it could understand.
    
    You know why we don't have New Testament prophets? It’s because we don't, we won't
    stay with the word of God. If we stayed with the word of God, God would produce some New
    Testament prophets. He’d produce some New Testament Apostles; He’d produce some miracles;
    He’d produce the dead raised and more than that too; He’d produce the creative power of God. If

    2 Listen, we say about Satan’s big machine up there, ready to move, that’s right, to crush down;
    but, remember, God’s little flock that believes the Word, its mechanics is ready too. It’s ready for
    the Dynamics to set it afire with the Holy Ghost. “Fear not, little flock, it’s your Father’s good
    will to give you the Kingdom.” The Holy Ghost will strike a little Church that’s come out from

    37
    the world, women that wears long hair, Nazarite, to prove they’ve separated themselves from
    the… 73 The Nazarite is one who…What? A one that separates themselves, for the Word of
    God; not short-wearing, painted faces, Jezebels, calling themselves Christians; no, sir; man, so
    wishy-washy, that’ll stand for a denomination, and hold onto their coat tails, of some Caesar
    or Herod, instead of standing for the Word of God. But God has got loyal people, genuine
    flock of God, who don’t care what the world says. They believe that Jesus Christ is the same
    yesterday, today, and forever. 74 This is not popular. It makes you unpopular, but it’s the
    Truth! It’s God’s command for it to be done, and God will do it. God bless you. Don’t mean to
    scold you, but to warn you. It’s better to be scorched than burned, at any time, so take warning.
    The Holy Spirit speaks in this last days. 75 All is written in the Book will escape it. Now we find
    out, the little flock is ready for the Dynamics to move It up into the skies, to escape all this
    tribulation. 76 Someone said, the other day when I was talking, said, “Brother Branham, you
    don’t believe then the church will go through the tribulation?” 77 I said, “I believe the church
    will, but not the Bride.” The church will go through the tribulation, yes, sir, but the Bride is
    free from it. She’ll go in the Rapture, in a moment, in a twinkling of an eye. She’ll be caught
    up to meet her Lord in the air, for the Wedding Supper. She has nothing to go through any
    tribulation about; her Lord has paid her price. We’re so thankful for that. Yes, sir. 78 After the
    rejection, of both church and nation, there was only one cry come, the next move, was, “Get rid
    of It!” 79 That’s the next cry we have. The church has firmly turned down the Holy Spirit. We
    know it has. Oh, members has come out of everything, that’s the great call, Presbyterian,
    Methodist, Baptist, Lutheran; but the church, itself, the denomination, it cannot move. No, sir.
    It’s already denominated. What’s the thing of it is now? “Crucify It! Crucify It!” What?
    Crucifying, afresh, (what?) the a vindicated Word, to be the Truth. God’s Word, crucified,
    afresh. Just as Eve corrupted the whole physical world, by rejecting one little bit of God’s
    Word, so has the church did the same thing. 80 You may say to me, “Brother Branham, you’ve
    got the wrong interpretation of It.” Well, that’s to your opinion. 81 God don’t need any
    interpreter. God is His Own interpreter. That’s what the trouble of it is, today, we got too many
    man-made interpreters. God can interpret, Himself. His Own vindication of His Word is the
    interpretation.
    I tell you; God don't like somebody wishy-washy. “Oh, I believe he was a prophet, but I
    don't believe he is a teacher.” Show me that in the Bible somewhere. And the little sheep... The
    ministers put all kinds of fears on them and say how that message is all messed up. But they
    would not tell him that, would they? They would not stand and tell him that.
    Like the four hundred that laid a trap for him, in Chicago. And the Angel of the Lord
    come to him and revealed everything they said and where they was going to have the meeting
    and everything. And then he challenged four hundred of them to stand by his side with their
    Bible and disprove the seed of the serpent, predestination and election and eternal security and
    the grace of God and the oneness of the God-Head and water baptism in Jesus' Name. There was
    not a one of them guys stand to their feet. JUST A BUNCH OF WISHY-WASHY, THAT IS

    them and he... they hand it out, the bread. Praise the Name of the Living God.

    387 That proves that God speaks His Message through His servants. Always has. That’s right.
    388 Now, the power of the believing Church. “Christ has all power in heavens and earth.” You
    believe that? [Congregation says, “Amen.”—Ed.] Now, what if He’s in you? Has Christ got all
    power? [“Amen.”] Matthew 28:18. All right. HE IS THE SEED-WORD IN HIS BODY. AND
    HE, IN US, BECOMES THE SEED-WORD IN US. What? All that God was, He poured into
    Christ; and all Christ was, was poured into the Church. That’s the power. 389 Now watch.
    Remember God’s law of reproduction, now, remember, “After its kind.” That right?
    [Congregation says, “Amen.”—Ed.] The Seed of Christ, the Word, must come through His
    Body. Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! 390 Are you getting tired? [Congregation says, “No.”—Ed.] All right.
    Just a minute now. Let’s just hold quiet and pray. I want to get this in, real good. I want this to
    grind down. 391 The Seed of Christ must, m-u-s-t, must come through His Body; not through
    a denomination, but through a born-again Seed of the Word, must come through. Now,
    remember. What is it? Christ’s Seed. How does my seed come? Through the body. How does
    the apple tree seed come? Through the body. 392 Seed is through the Body, and the Church is
    the Body of Christ. That right? [Congregation says, “Amen.”—Ed.] The Bible Church! THIS
    BIRTH PRODUCES (THAT’S THE NEW BIRTH) HIMSELF IN BODY, HIS CHURCH, IS
    HIS WORD, SO THAT PEOPLE CAN SEE THE CONFIRMATION OF HEBREWS 13:8,
    “JESUS CHRIST THE SAME YESTERDAY, TODAY, AND FOREVER.” You believe it?
    [“Amen.”] These are not domi-…denominational hybrids, now. This is those that’s in the orbit,
    waiting for the countdown, you know what I mean, fixing to take a rocket. Glory! These are not
    denominational hybrids; not standing in Here, they’re not. No, sir. It’s the Seed. 393 Paul was
    afraid that the people would watch some kind of a big words that he could say, some of his
    education. First Corinthians 2:1 to 8. You want to put it down. First Corinthians 2:1 to 8, Paul
    said, “I never come to you, speaking words intellectual, you know, that your faith might be in
    some seminary thing. BUT I COME TO YOU WITH THE SIMPLICITY, IN THE POWER
    AND DEMONSTRATION OF THE HOLY GHOST, THAT YOUR WORD…THAT YOUR
    FAITH WOULD REST IN THE WORD OF GOD.” YES, SIR.

    205 Look how fitting that is with Malachi 4, “Restore the Faith, back to the fathers,” Abraham’s
    Seed be restored back to the kind of Faith that father Abraham had, his royal Seed. Malachi 4 to
    be fulfilled, is to restore back the Faith that was once back there in the beginning, restore It back
    to the royal Seed of Abraham. It’s a promise. It’s exactly the promise. THE ROYAL SEED IS
    TO BE REVEALED, AND BY A…BY THE ROYAL SEED, WHICH IS THE ROYAL SEED,
    OF CHRIST. CHRIST IS THE ROYAL SEED. And the Seed is the Holy Spirit that’s in the

    41
    hearts of the people that believe in God, that hold His Word, and God working through them,
    carrying the same Message. “A little while and the world seeth Me no more, yet ye shall see
    Me; I’ll be with you, even in you. And the works that I do, you’ll do also.” See, revealing it in
    the last days here, how it’s supposed to come.
    You know, over in II Kings, we read about Jehu, which stayed with the word of the
    eunuch, Elijah. God's great spiritual eunuch, Elijah. Do you believe Elijah was a eunuch? He
    sure was. He came stumping out of the wilderness, "THUS SAITH THE LORD, it’ll not rain but
    according to my word." Ugh!
    1 Kings 17:1-Reference quote:
    1 And Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the inhabitants of Gilead, said unto Ahab, As the Lord God

    425 Like Elijah, after that mighty, vindicated prophet that the Word of God came to, had
    finished preaching His message to the modern American groups of the First Lady, with their
    bobbed-hairs and Jezebel-paint groups. God confirming His prophet; every time he
    prophesied, it was the truth. GOD HAD TO CALL HIM OFF OF THE FIELD, until He
    plagued that generation with mighty plagues, FOR REJECTING THE MESSAGE OF HIS
    PROPHET AND THE WORD OF GOD THAT HE HAD SENT TO THEM. God sent him into
    the wilderness, in hiding, not even the king could call him out. And them that tried to persuade
    him against the will of God, died for doing so. (O God! Whew. Uh!) BUT WHEN GOD SPOKE
    TO HIS FAITHFUL PROPHET BY A VISION, OUT OF THE WILDERNESS HE COME
    WITH THUS SAITH THE LORD. What did he do? Straight to the Word, back to the Word he
    went, brought the twelve stones and rolled them together. 426 LIKE JOHN THE BAPTIST,
    CHRIST’S FAITHFUL FORERUNNER, THE ANOINTED PROPHET. No school of his
    father, no school of Pharisee, no denomination could call him from the wilderness where God
    had sent him, UNTIL HE HEARD THE VOICE OF GOD. “THE MESSIAH IS AT HAND.”
    (Are you listening, spiritual mind? What more could I say here. I’m skipping something here
    now.)
    And then we find out that Elisha took his place. And Elisha told the little man to take this
    box of ointment and go down and find Jehu and pour this upon old Jehu's head and anoint him
    king over Israel. And, oh, little ole prophet ran down there, on an errand for Elisha, and
    found Jehu and ran in there, called him in the room there and dumped that on and told him,
    "THUS SAITH THE LORD, you are anointed king over Israel. And you’ll destroy the seed of
    Ahab."

    42
    2 Kings 9:6-8-Reference quote:
    6 And he arose, and went into the house; and he poured the oil on his head, and said unto him,
    Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, I have anointed thee king over the people of the Lord, even
    over Israel.
    7 And thou shalt smite the house of Ahab thy master, that I may avenge the blood of my servants
    the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of the Lord, at the hand of Jezebel.
    8 For the whole house of Ahab shall perish: and I will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against
    the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel:
    And we find out that Jehu rose up and went after the seed of Ahab, right then, and began
    to kill them. And then he had the prophecy of the Lord that he was to slay old Jezebel. And we
    find out that he went down to the palace and he came down to the palace and hollered for Jezebel
    and old Jezebel came out. Before she came out, she painted her lips all up. And that’s where we
    get all this make-up, now, from Jezebel. Amen. That’s where we get it. I know, boy, I am
    meddling, now, but that is the truth. You know that a spiritual eunuch will tell you that, you
    know. It is the only kind that will tell ya that, in this day.
    2 Kings 9:30-37-Reference quote:
    30 And when Jehu was come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it; and she painted her face, and tired
    her head, and looked out at a window.
    31 And as Jehu entered in at the gate, she said, Had Zimri peace, who slew his master?
    32 And he lifted up his face to the window, and said, Who is on my side? who? And there looked
    out to him two or three eunuchs.
    33 And he said, Throw her down. So they threw her down: and some of her blood was sprinkled
    on the wall, and on the horses: and he trode her under foot.
    34 And when he was come in, he did eat and drink, and said, Go, see now this cursed woman,
    and bury her: for she is a king's daughter.
    35 And they went to bury her: but they found no more of her than the skull, and the feet, and the
    palms of her hands.
    36 Wherefore they came again, and told him. And he said, This is the word of the Lord, which he
    spake by his servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying, In the portion of Jezreel shall dogs eat the flesh
    of Jezebel:
    37 And the carcase of Jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of the field in the portion of
    Jezreel; so that they shall not say, This is Jezebel.
    
    I thought I heard a spiritual eunuch, not too long ago, in a big tent meeting. He, boy, he
    would just lay that thing down on holiness, but after a little while, he said, "Oh, he knew how he
    had power with God." He just preaches holiness and that’s why God anointed. But then we find
    out that popularity, money was too much for him and then he went the way of all the rest of
    them. You know why? He was not a spiritual eunuch. He had his own seed to plant. You know
    what his seed was? A great ministry. See? He had a will.

    43
    You take a man that is a eunuch, he has no will to get married because he ain’t got no
    seed to plant. Don't you get it?
    But he had a seed to plant. He had his own will and that was a great evangelistic
    ministry. Great, great man of power and all this, See. He had his own seed to plant. But it’ll take
    the spiritual eunuch to tell you not to paint your face like a Jezebel and don't cut your hair
    because that is a mark of a Jezebel. And the Bible said that the long hair of the woman was her
    glory. Then why do you cut it off? I know why? Because you have not been listening to a
    spiritual eunuch and it is their fault. A real child of God has got to hear the word of God to be
    able to overcome. Amen!
    1 Corinthians 11:15-Reference quote:
    15 But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering.
    But a spiritual eunuch, in this hour, will tell you that you’ve to… you women, have to
    let your hair grow out in order to be able to perfume your body for the king. That’s some of the
    oil that goes along with perfuming, preparing your body. Amen! But it’ll take a spiritual eunuch
    of God to preach those things, in this hour, because he don't care about no personal ministry. He
    don't care about if anybody ever hears his name. There’s only one thing down in his soul that’s
    driving him and that is the seed of the King. Plant the seed, plant the seed.
    Well, we find out that, when Jehu came down there to the palace and hollered for
    Jezebel and she... before she came out, oh, she fixed her hair up, you know, and painted her face
    up. She thought that she could trap Jehu, like she trapped Ahab with her beauty. You ought to
    read the history of Jezebel, was a very beguiling, very beautiful woman. She captivated Ahab by
    her beauty and got him off of the word of God by her beauty.
    And that’s the way the devil does in this hour. The devil will get the women that should
    be virtuous toward keeping the word of God and letting their hair grow long and living holiness,
    he’ll get them off of that by the beauty of Jezebel. Said how they got to look beautiful for this
    and for that.
    Oh, we find out that Jehu came up to the palace there and Jezebel fixed herself up real
    beautiful and sashayed out there, you know, thinking, oh, she would just woo old Jehu right over,
    you know. And Jehu looked up there and said, "Who is on my side?" And about that time, three
    eunuchs stepped out. Said, "Who is on my side? Let him throw this Jezebel, this wicked woman
    down to the ground." And Brother, them eunuchs picked her up and dashed her to the ground.
    And so is it, in this hour, it’ll be the spiritual eunuchs of God that take this Jezebel
    religion and this old denominational World Council of Churches and all the rest of this tommyrot
    that Jezebel planted in all these other ministers and throw it and dash it to the ground because
    they don't have any seed. They’re not enticed with all their beautiful popularity and beautiful
    buildings and promise you another Cadillac if you’ll only preach this. No, they’ll be eunuchs just
    like those that throwed Jezebel down to the ground.
    God sayin, in this hour, "Who is on My side? Let him throw this Jezebel doctrine to the
    ground." “Oh no, we want to go the way of popularity, though. It’s not popular to preach Acts
    2:38.”

    38 Well, I better stop on them. ’Cause brother, I believe it’s either right or wrong. There’s no
    dividing line. You’re either in or out. And if you do those things, it shows you’re out. “If you love
    the world or the things of the world, the love of God’s not even in you,” said Jesus. That’s right.
    So just by their fruits you shall know them. Now, I’m standing behind the pulpit; I’m not meaning
    personally to anybody; I’m saying what God said. I’m responsible for preaching it. And God
    holds you responsible the way you act about it. That’s right. Amen. Oh, it’s the truth. And there I
    noticed back there, that when he spoke to the rock, the rock give its waters. 39 There was a man
    one day by the name of Elijah. The Lord told him, “Now, I’m going to make a way of escape. I’m
    going to send you up yonder on the mountain. I want you to stay up there, ’cause it ain’t going to
    rain for three years and six months.” And that old preacher stomped right up there before that
    king and said, “The dew is not even going to fall from heaven till I call for it.” How did he do
    that? He knowed what God said was the truth. Walks up there on the hill, and I can hear him
    say, “King Ahab,” said, “looky here. Tell Jezebel…” His little painted up wife, you know, with
    all that manicure over her face and… You know, Pentecostal women do that too. Brother, God…
    40 Listen, let me tell you something. I might as well get it right here. A long time ago that was
    wrong to do it. But it isn’t no more. Just like they took the old Charlie BarleyCorn with that
    scarecrow hat on, Old Charlie… Put him in bumpers in a can, put him in the ice box. You dress
    him up a little bit, but he’s still Charlie BarleyCorn. Just as much sin to drink it out of a bumper
    as it was out of the old barrel a long time ago. Right. Let me tell you something, women. If
    you’re guilty of that, listen, I will tell you what will complexion you better than anything. Take
    this little bit of—of the Gospel in your heart. That’s right. It will take care of it. Let me tell you;
    there’s only one woman in the Bible that ever painted her face to meet men. And that was
    Jezebel. And God fed her to the dogs. Now, if you see a woman with a lot of paint on her face,
    say, “There’s Miss Dog meat.” That’s what God said. That’s exactly right. That’s Miss Dog
    meat. That’s what the Bible… And God fed her to the dogs. That’s… Amen. 41 Brother, what we
    need is an old time, Holy Ghost sent, Gospel power of God to straighten up the Church and get
    back into the ring like they ought to be. God help these preachers; I ain’t talking about these:
    hanging along with little old kid gloves on, afraid they’re going to hurt somebody feelings. I’d
    rather hurt every man in the world and be in friendship with God. Tell the truth. God will honor
    it. Amen. “Amen” means, “so be it.” Don’t get scared. That won’t hurt you.
    The only place it is popular is to go into the United PC, go into a denomination then it
    will be popular then. It’s not popular to baptize in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ. It’s not
    popular to believe the messenger of Malachi 4. It’s not popular to preach predestination. It’s not
    popular to preach seed of the serpent. You would not have no open doors to preach in.

    240 But there was two out of the twelve, Joshua and Caleb, said they looked at the Word. “God
    said it’s ours, and we are more than able to take it.” Is that right? [Congregation says,
    “Amen.”—Ed.] 241 What was that? Borderline believers. See, they were actually born in the
    church. They were heads of the people. They were bishops, as to say, that walked right down to
    where the Word of God was shown to be the Truth. “There is the land!” They had never been
    there. They didn’t know it was there. But they come down to see it was there. “There it was!”
    And Caleb and Joshua went over, and brought back a—a—a bunch of grapes and let them eat
    some of it. And they tasted of the good land, and then went back and said, “We can’t do it. See?
    We just can’t do it.” 242 Here is the same group, in the time of Jesus Christ. “Rabbi, we know
    Thou art a teacher come from God.” See? Borderline! “We know Thou art a teacher come from
    God. No man could do the things that You do. We recognize that God has to be there.” Why
    didn’t they accept it? Why didn’t they take it? Borderline! Borderline! 243 Here they are on this
    third exodus; same sign, same manifestation, same Christ, same Holy Ghost, same works,
    same God, same Message, and they can’t take It. They’d have to give up their fellowship card.
    What is it? “They’ve had a knowledge of the Truth.” They looked and seen that it’s absolutely
    the Truth. They can’t deny It. The magazines has to testify they seen It. The pictures, the papers,
    the evidence, the resurrection of the dead, the doctors’ statements of the sick, they have to say
    that it’s Him. And the predictions, not one of them ever failing down through the years, every one
    of them just exactly on the dot, they can’t say but what it’s God. But they can’t accept It. 244
    That bunch of ministers in Chicago, three hundred and something of them, was going to come
    down and be baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ. Where they at? The price is too great. They
    can’t do it. What is it? The Bible said, when they do that, what do they do? They separate
    themselves between mercy and judgment. “For it is impossible for those that were once
    enlightened,” has been brought to look at It, “and had a knowledge of the Truth, and have tasted
    of the good Word of God, if they return away from It, where they’d have to renew themselves
    again, say, ‘Well, now, I will, yes,…’” 245 You Presbyterians, you Methodists, and Baptists, and
    Lutherans, and this Full Gospel Business Men’s stuff, saying they’re “coming in,” turned away
    the Message. Your church will. There’ll be individuals in there, sure. But, not the church; you
    have to come out of the church, to get It. See? That’s right. Individuals is all right. 246 But when
    you think the Presbyterian church is going to receive the Holy Ghost, and all of them take their
    documents down, and, don’t you never think that. And you think you Methodists is going to do it?
    You’ll never do it. Do you think you Trinitarians will ever receive the Name of Jesus Christ and
    be baptized every one of you in the…You’ll never do it. You’ll never do it. But individuals will
    come out and do it, that’s right, and that’s the sign of His Coming. But them churches who has
    seen the Truth, and rejected It in their councils, “it’s impossible.” 247 Then, they’re guilty of
    the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. And I indict them by the Word of God, that God has… “How
    do you indict them, Brother Branham?” I indict them, that God has clearly identified Himself
    in His Word, in the last days, and made Hisself to know that He is still the same yesterday,
    today, and forever, and they’ve coldly turned It down. And you’re guilty of the crucifixion of
    Jesus Christ, by blaspheming the Holy Ghost. That’s right. 248 We take you on to Hebrews 10,
    again, where it tells us again in the Scriptures, not only being “impossible,” but you can never.
    It separates you from God, Eternally. You can never come in the Presence of God again, when

    46
    you turn down the Holy Ghost and make fun of It. 249 Now, see, “have tasted of the Word.”
    See, borderline believers! “Oh, you say them guys wasn’t believers?” 250 They was believers, or
    professed believers, but when it come to the Word…They were Israel. They come out under the
    blood. They come out under the signs of Moses. They had seen those signs working. God said,
    “I’ll take you over yonder.” 251 And when it come right down to the principle of the promised
    Word that was to come, what’d they say? “Oh, we can’t do it.” See? 252 And here they come
    back, with grapes and everything, to prove the land was right. God’s Word is right. God said, “I
    give it to you.” 253 But the circumstances, “My,” said, “we look like grasshoppers, up aside of
    them. We can’t do it, no matter what.” 254 A few years ago when this old hull stood here as a
    tabernacle, somebody come in, and walked out there and talked to me, said, “Billy, you’re
    going to preach to four posts, one of these days, with Messages like that.” 255 I said, “I’ll be
    preaching to four posts, ’cause God’s able of them posts to rise children unto Abraham.” Yes,
    sir. It’s the Truth. I said, “If you’ve got something that you can disprove It, let’s have it.” Just
    love to crow, but when it comes to a place to show it, that’s different. Yes, that’s what makes the
    difference. All right. 256 Yeah, with their creeds they crucify Him afresh. Now Hebrews the 6th
    chapter, and we go on down. And we could just read on down, on down in through here. We got
    plenty of time. I marked out a Scripture here where it will be, Hebrews the 6th chapter. Just, I
    guess, take it all. “Impossible for those who were once enlightened, made partakers of the Holy
    Ghost…” We haven’t got time to go too far, ’cause I got another Scripture I want you to read
    just in a moment. Notice this, “They crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh.” What’d they
    do? What? By having a taste, and knowing that It’s the Truth, and then turn around and denying
    It. What’d it do? “It’s impossible…”
    
    
    And preachers say, "Well, Brother Lambert, don't you think God would be pleased with
    me if I just would not baptize that way?" "Don't you think the Lord would be pleased with me if I
    just did not preach seed of the serpent?" No, I don't. I think you need to be a spiritual eunuch and
    just plant what God said to plant. And let him take care of it. It’s his Bride; it’s his Bible; it’s his
    kingdom; it’s his world; it’s his creation. Why not? If you say that you’re an ambassador of the
    Lord Jesus Christ, why don't you say only what he said?
    Paul said that he was a preacher. And you know a preacher, in that day that the Apostle
    Paul was preaching in, was called an ambassador. He was an ambassador of the king, the Roman
    emperor. And this preacher, as we get our word 'preacher,' he was a herald. And as the emperor
    gave him a message, he went into the cities and the townships and declared the message that the
    emperor gave him. And remember, this herald, this messenger only told exactly what the king
    said.
    And I think that... I think that is what the preachers of this hour ought to do. Brother, if
    they say that they are the ambassadors of Christ, why don't they only proclaim what Christ said
    then and plant the seed of the word? No, they can't do it. You know why? Because they are not
    the ambassadors of Christ or they would be spiritual eunuchs. They would only plant what God
    said to plant. But it’s not popular, as I said before.
    And that is the same thing that the devil tried to get Jesus with. Said, "Come up here and
    bow down to me and I’ll give you all these kingdoms of the world." Said, "Thou shalt worship
    the Lord Thy God and Him only shall thou serve." Why did He say that? Is because he was a
    spiritual Eunuch and a spiritual eunuch don't have no seed of his own. He just has the Seed of the
    King to plant. He said, "It is written; it is written; it is written."

    Matthew 4:8-10-Reference quote:
    8 Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth him all the
    kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them;

    10 Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the
    Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.
    But the three eunuchs picked old Jezebel up and threw her to the ground and her blood
    splattered all over the horses and all over the buildings and Jehu trampled her to death with the
    horse.
    Brother, it wouldn’t surprise me if the great Lord Jesus Christ, the great Jehu that’s
    riding, in this hour, on a great white horse, in Revelation 19, that’s coming to trample this
    Jezebel religion into the ground with that great white horse and with the Sword of the King. Do
    you believe it saints? I believe that Jesus Christ is going to drop hailstones from heaven on this
    old Jezebel religion and her doctrine.

    12 His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name
    written, that no man knew, but he himself.
    13 And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his name is called The Word of God.
    14 And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen,
    white and clean.

    shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of

    16 And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD
    OF LORDS.

    He’ll stone it from heaven, with hailstones weighing a talent apiece, which is a hundred
    pounds. The adulterous church will die, adulterous world will die under the punishment of
    God, under stoning, like He did in the beginning. Get right with God, church!
     Well Brother, where is the Truth that’s evil spoken of? I ask you? I asked you a
    question. Where is the Truth that is evil spoken of? Is it the Methodist? Is it the Baptist? Is it the

    would be a truth that would be evil spoken of."

     And said, "As Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these withstand the Truth, men

    56-0115 - The Junction Of Time
    William Marrion Branham
    
    56 Then I want you to notice, every time the miraculous was done, Satan is always there to
    counterfeit it. And as he was counterfeiting in that day, he is still the same counterfeiter today.
    Even his counterfeits ONLY POINT TO THE END TIME AT THE JUNCTION. 57 They had
    some old soothsayers, and down there, by the name of Jannes and Jambres, who stood up. And
    they could throw their rods down and turn them to serpents, and so forth, and do just like he,
    they did. But God vindicated who was God. They could bring plagues, but they could not
    perform Divine healing, ’cause God alone can heal. And they could bring a boil, but they
    couldn’t take it away. GOD STOOD IN HIS POWER THERE, TO SHOW THAT REAL
    DIVINE HEALING WAS HIS MIRACULOUS, TO PROVE THE OMNIPOTENCE AT THE
    JUNCTION ROAD. 58 The Egyptians called the boils, but they broke out themselves. But God’s
    servant could take them away. Why? They can counterfeit. 59 We are taught, in this last days,
    that there would be the same thing. “As Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so will these

    49
    resist the Truth; men of reprobate mind, concerning the faith.” How that they would do!
    “Heady, high-minded; lovers of pleasure more than God; trucebreakers, incontinent. Having
    a form of godliness.” 60 Oh, how the day we’re living, the junction road; at the end of the
    road, the end of the age! God is proving it. What a marvelous day to be living. 61 God proved
    to them, and vindicated Himself, and got glory. How that He went down there in Egypt and
    smote the nation! How that He brought Israel out on the eagle wings, and performed signs and
    wonders, because He is our Omnipotent. And He does the miraculous. 62 Before He sunk
    Pharaoh’s chariots, He give every kind of a sign. He give signs of Divine healing. He give signs
    and all vindications of His power. How He could save an elder son, or take an elder son. How
    He could destroy, or how He could save life. How He could perform miracles. He could do the
    miraculous. And how the sun and moon turned dark! How the hail swept the ground. How the
    lightning swept over the country and killed the cattle, and so forth, just like it did in the days of
    Noah. 63 And He said, “In the last days, the moon shall fail to give her light, and the sun won’t
    shine. And she’ll turn black as sackcloth; drip like blood,” when she hides her face and weeps,
    herself, and sweats out bloody drops of grief. God will be on the earth, Omnipotent, doing the
    miraculous. Certainly. He can. He is omnipotent. Think of it. 64 There, down there in Egypt, how
    He performed those signs and wonders, and the things that He had done! He is God. None can
    take His place. 65 Notice, God performed His miracle, and He give Pharaoh a chance. And
    Pharaoh failed and refused to take his chance. There was nothing left. 66 When a man spurns
    the mercy of God, there is only one thing left, that’s judgment. And, my dear friend, today,
    God helping us, when you see the end of this text come, and if you spurn the mercy that’s
    offered you by Jesus Christ, the Holy Ghost, there will be nothing left but Divine judgment.
    There can’t be nothing left.
    
    And they’re the ones that speak evil of the dignities. And that word 'dignity' is the
    officers of the Lord Jesus Christ, his prophets and his apostles and his pastors and his teachers
    that are spiritual eunuchs. They speak evil of the message that they preach. And it said, "And
    they shall utterly perish as in the gainsaying of Korah." Amen.

    64-0313 - The Voice Of The Sign
    William Marrion Branham
    57 And, now, there was the sign to attract the prophet. Now, there, that sign has got to have a
    voice. And when that voice spoke, if It would not have been Scriptural, I don’t believe the
    prophet would have listened to it. But watch how Scriptural the voice was that accompanied the
    sign, it proved it was God, for He said, “I have heard the groans of My people, and I remember
    the promise that I made to them.” See, the sign, then the Scriptural voice behind the sign. 58
    Now that shows exactly what I’ve just background. It must be a sign from God, and, if it is,
    there is a Scriptural voice behind it, for the promise of that day. Not the same old school; the
    rabbis and things had been going through the schools, or the everything, all along, all along, the
    priests, and so forth. But this is something new, and it’s Scriptural, it’s a promise; and a sign
    to attract the prophet. 59 And then, He said now, before he goes down there, he has got to
    have something to a vindicate himself of being a prophet, see, before they would receive him.
    Said, “They won’t say the Lord has appeared to me.” 60 Said, “Then, I’ll give you two signs to
    do, and that will attract the people’s attention. And when the attention of the people is
    attracted, then speak these words to them, ‘I’m the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and I
    remember My promise.’ And I’ve sent you down to deliver them, and I’ll be with you.” 61 Did
    you notice his first sign? He had all kinds of impersonations of them. Everybody tried to throw
    down a serpent. That’s…If that ain’t the run of people, I don’t know what is, see. See? But what
    kind of a voice did they have behind it? Nothing; the Egyptian voice of the world. Yet they could
    perform the sign, but they didn’t have the voice behind it, to back it up. But Moses had THUS
    SAITH THE LORD. That was the difference. Impersonators finally went on for a long time, but
    finally it played out. 62 Do you know the Bible said that would take place again in the last

    51
    days? “As Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so would man of reprobate mind concerning
    the Truth.” Who is Truth? Jesus Christ is Truth. See? “Reprobate mind concerning the
    Truth.” 63 NOW JEHOVAH IS GOING TO SPEAK BY HIS PROMISED WORD. He must
    then get this prophet ready to send down. Because, it’s always in His line of thinking, His line of
    doing, every time send His prophet with the Word, and a vindicates the prophet. 64 Again, this is
    a promised sign. A prophet, himself, is a sign. The Bible said so. When you see times lapsing,
    and then see coming… Take the history of the Bible, study it. Whenever you seen a long lapse of
    time; but just when you seen a prophet appear on, it was the sign of judgment. God was going
    to judge the world, when He…or the nation, or the people, when you saw a prophet coming.
    I’ve preached a sermon on it, you tape man remember, the…A True Sign Overlooked. They
    always overlook it, they always have, but it was a sign of a coming judgment. 65 NOW HIS
    WORD IS FULFILLED IN HIS VOICE. WHAT HE PROMISES, THEN HE FULFILLS
    HIS WORD BY THE VOICE. 66 The coming of a prophet is a warning sign that judgment is
    at hand. Always has been. Let me just quote one. 67 Look at Noah rising up in the last, in the—in
    the days of the antediluvian world, a prophet prophesying. What was it? Judgment struck
    immediately after. 68 Moses went into Egypt, a vindicated prophet with the signs of the prophet.
    What happened? Judgment struck Egypt right afterwards. 69 Elijah come on the scene, the
    prophet, and prophesied to Ahab and that nation. What happened? Judgment struck it right
    afterwards. Right. 70 John the Baptist come on, as a sign. He was a prophet. He was a
    prophet-sign come on the earth. THEY KNOWED, WHEN HE COME ON, THE MESSIAH
    WOULD SPEAK, AFTER HIM. It had to be, ’cause, get the—get the elected. 71 What this is
    for is to get the elected people that’s coming out, like in the days of Noah. Like in the days of—
    of Elijah, the seven thousand or seven hundred, or whatever it was, that hadn’t bowed their knee,
    to call them out. JOHN CALLING OUT THE ELECTED, AND GIVE IT OVER TO CHRIST
    WHEN HE COME, SWAPPED HIS CHURCH, SAID, “I MUST DECREASE, HE MUST
    INCREASE, BECAUSE,” HE SAID, “I’M JUST A VOICE OF HIM, CRYING IN THE
    WILDERNESS, ‘PREPARE THE WAY FOR THE LORD.’” AND JESUS COME THE
    SAME WAY. GETS THE ELECTED READY TO HEAR THE VOICE OF GOD, THAT’S
    WHAT THE PROPHETIC SIGN IS. Oh, if you follow these Messages, get the per-…get the
    elected ready. Not the others, will never hear it. It’s the elected that’s called. 72 Where did that
    Angel come to, in Sodom, that did that sign? To Abraham and his group. “Stay away from
    Sodom; it’s going to burn!” See? Jesus promised it to repeat, you know, again, at this Sodom.
    Now notice. 73 What does it do? It gets the elected ready for the shelter of God, like in Noah’s
    time, so forth. 74 And what does it do? It condemns the intellectual unbeliever, to judgment. It
    always has. To spurn mercy, nothing left but judgment. So it gets the—the intellectual and the
    unbeliever ready for the judgment. Because, what do they do? They condemn it.
    Don't you worry, God is getting ready to do something. Don't you think that. Don't you
    worry about it. Jesus Christ is getting ready to move on the scene with a mighty demonstration of
    his spirit. But it’ll be a demonstration of Jehu because the prophet pronounced a curse upon this
    church world and the Bible said that THIS LAODICEAN CHURCH AGE WAS TO END IN
    COMPLETE APOSTASY. AND “APOSTASY” MEANS THAT YOU HAVE REJECTED
    THE REVEALED TRUTH THAT HE SENT YOU THROUGH A PROPHET. YOU TURNED
    IT DOWN.

    Brother and Sister, I believe with all my heart that the only thing that can come forth from God
    Almighty today, as much as I hate to say it and hate to see it come forth. And yet it’s so needful, is
    for God to raise up a prophet of God and bring forth the judgments of God to this thing. It’s
    true. As sure as I stand here, it’ll sure be that way, too. The Bible said judgment begins at the
    house of God. And God’s gonna have a church without spot, without wrinkle, without blemish or
    any such thing. Christ wants to so dwell among His people and the only way that He can do it is
    to come and stand upon the earth and bring judgment to the thing. See? All them money beggars
    out there and all them false prophets. All them false preachers riding around, fat off of tithes
    and offerings of the people. God’s gonna pull this thing out in the open here. He sure will do

    It. “It condemns and does these things, and tells our people these things we don’t want to get
    mixed amongst our organizations. It’s against our creeds.” They crucify Him again. Oh, my!
    Notice now as we’re closing. Got to close. And, again, they call It “fanaticism.” 347 And they
    called Him a “fanatic.” They said, “He was crazy.” Anybody knows that the Bible said that,
    “Jesus was,” them Pharisees said, “this Man is a Samaritan, and He’s mad.” Now what does
    the word mad mean? “Crazy.” “The Man is crazy. They’re a bunch of crazy people follow Him.
    He is Beelzebub.” 348 And, again, they say the same thing, “It’s a sort of witchcraft. It’s
    fortune-telling,” placing Him again on the cross of shame. What cross? What shame? His a
    vindicated Word; making fun of It, telling the people It’s the devil. Making something, and call…
    349 He said, “They calling the holy works of God ‘an unclean spirit doing it,’ no forgiveness for

    go to it. Don’t attend them meetings.” Uh-huh. 351 What do they do by doing that? They take
    their denominational creed nails. That’s right. These pleasure-hunting teachers, worldly,
    ungodly, denominational mad, take the denominational nails and crucify the Son of God with it,
    afresh, from their pulpits. 352 Why do they do this? “They love the praises of men,” the degrees

    And why do you call It…Ain’t one Calvary enough? 355 As Peter said, “Your denominational

    REPENT AND TURN TO GOD, OR PERISH. 357 AND AGAIN I SAY, “HERE,” THE

    wonder it’s again: Mid rending rocks and darkening skies My Saviour bowed His head and
    died, But the opening veil revealed the way To Heaven’s joys and endless day. 358 I say it on
    this tape, and for this audience. I say this under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost. WHO IS ON
    THE LORD’S SIDE, LET HIM COME UNDER THIS WORD! God will surely bring this
    wicked, Christ-denying, Christ-rejecting generation into judgment, for blasphemy, the
    crucifixion of His identified Word. THEY ARE COMING TO THE JUDGMENT. I INDICT
    IT! “Who is on the Lord’s side,” said Moses, “let him come unto me,” when the Pillar of Fire
    hanging there as an evidence. WHO IS ON THE LORD’S SIDE, LET HIM TAKE UP THE
    WORD, DENY HIS CREED, AND FOLLOW JESUS CHRIST DAILY. And I’ll meet you in
    the morning.

    Christ. Now, you believe that? [Congregation says, “Amen.”—Ed.] We have to be in Christ. In
    Christ, we have to be of Christ, in Christ, part of Christ. 139 What is a woman, when she takes
    a man, or a man takes a woman? That woman has to be part of him. They’re no longer two.
    They’re one. 140 And when God and Christ became one, They were One. Cause, God was the
    Word, and the Word was made flesh. The flesh and the Word became One. And when the
    church becomes Christ’s Bride, She and the Gospels are the same. 141 How can you say, then,
    “The days of miracles is past”? How can you say, then, “He’s not the same yesterday, today,
    and forever”? How can you say, “Those things is for an apostle or a disciple, or somebody in
    another day,” when you are part of Him? 142 When, He said, “Heavens and earth will pass
    away, but My Word shall never fail.” How about Revelation 22, when He got through writing the
    Book? He said, “I testify that if any man shall add one word, or take one Word out of It, his part
    will be taken from the Book of Life.”
    
    But I tell you, Friend, tonight, I’d rather take the word, the way of the Lord's despised
    few, than take the broad way that leads to destruction in this so-called Pentecostal move, in this
    hour. Brother, they don't know anything about the true move of God. They don't care what the
    word of God said. They say, "Well, if you don't want to eat this round kosher like the Catholics
    do, just shut your eyes?"

    My Lord, you filthy, dirty Jezebel, you. Jehu will have you fall to the ground with his
    spiritual eunuchs, one day. Even as, so saith the prophet of God that passed away, said, "Howl
    and weep, you minister’s that heard this truth and turned it down, your hour is coming. God will
    visit you, one day." Don't you worry about it, he will.

    William Marrion Branham
    178 Oh, if you would speak to them! Oh, big, fine buildings, and so forth. Oh, they—they—
    they…You go to their church, you’d happen to say…Go to their church and say, “Well, I tell you,
    you are Pentecostal?” “Oh, yes. Uh-huh. Sure, we’re Pentecostal.” “You believe in being born
    again?” “Yes.” “Well, I want to show you something…” 179 “Oh, look at this building! You
    know how much building…this building cost? That cost three quarters of a million dollars to put
    this up. You know, we used to didn’t have it that way. We—we used to be down there at the
    alley.” Um-hum, and look around, you find out all these great things that they got. Yes, sir. And
    then they say, “Oh, we—we got all these big things!” But they have no burden for lost souls!
    They’re always wanting to show you how much building they got. “Look at our Sunday school
    record, how big it is!” What good does that do if they haven’t got the Holy Ghost? “Rich,
    increased in goods, have need of nothing.” 180 That’s what He said, “You think that, but
    don’t know that you’re poor, wretched, miserable, blind, naked. And don’t know it!” See?
    That’s it. 181 Oh, sure, they say, “You know what? We used to be…The little church we used to
    use is in the back part, this is the big one now!” And I tell you, no burden for souls, but they’ve
    got to see that all these things are taken care of. The ladies aid, and all these other things, all
    has to be taken care of, but no burden for lost souls. Oh, man, what—what this church has got
    into! 182 They were not burdened for souls, but they were burdened with wealth. That’s right.
    They had the wrong burden. They had a burden for their wealth but not a burden for lost
    souls. The Scripture said, “They didn’t know that they were wretched,” (Oh!) “miserable,
    blind.” 183 They think that they could take money and convert the world. “Oh, if we could just
    get a program on, that we could get a lot of money here, I believe we could convert the world.
    If some of the rich people in our church, Brother Branham, if we could just get them to dig
    out, and I believe that we could start a society that would—that would go around and—and
    convert the world. We could take airplanes and drop literature all over Africa, and things like
    that. If we just had some money!” 184 Brother, the world won’t be converted by money. THE
    WORLD WILL BE CONVERTED BY THE HOLY GHOST; POWERFUL PREACHING OF
    THE HOLY GHOST AND THE CROSS WILL BE THE ONLY THING THAT’LL
    CONVERT THE WORLD. God’s program is not money. It’s the Holy Ghost, that’s what God’s
    program is for the Laodicean Church Age or any other church age. Yes, sir. 185 They want the
    Holy Ghost. Oh, they say, “We are…have gold.” It was gold, all right, but not the right kind.
    They had plenty of gold but not the right kind. Now, so they were commanded by Jesus, “I know
    you are rich, and have gold, and have need of nothing,” but: I counsel thee to come buy of me
    gold tried in the fire,… 186 A different kind of gold, yeah, a gold that’s tried in the fiery furnace,
    that went through the fire of death, that went through Calvary, come out. 187 Lot of this gold you
    got now is tarnishie, it’ll canker, it’ll rust. IF YOU CAN MARK DOWN THIS,
    JAMES…SAINT JAMES 5:1 TO 4, AND YOU’LL GET WHAT IT IS, SAID, “GO YE, YOU
    RICH MEN, NOW AT THE COMING OF THE LORD, WEEP AND HOWL FOR YOUR
    MISERIES IS COME UPON YOU, YOUR GOLD IS CANKERED IN YOU.” See, that’s the
    kind of gold that cankers. 188 But the gold that Jesus gives is the Holy Spirit, the golden Oil of
    the Spirit, pours into your heart. And—and, oh, my, “Counsel of you, come buy of me gold, if
    you want to get rich.” Oh, yes. 189 Also, they were “blind.” Now, that’s a bad way to be. I don’t
    think these Christians was so blind as they was “nearsighted.” I believe they were nearsighted.

    58
    The only thing they could look at was their big buildings. Only thing they could look at was their
    big congregation. Only thing they looked at was a well-carn’ished choir with all of its big robes
    and things. I think they was just nearsighted, they couldn’t see over their nose, hardly. I don’t
    think they were blind, they were just nearsighted. All they could see was their… “Well, you know
    what? We belong to the So-and-so!” Their big denominations, their big crowds, many members,
    their Sunday school, their fine buildings. 190 “But they had need of the Holy Ghost,” Jesus said.
    They needed the Holy Ghost! So the Lord said to them, “Eye…If you are…eyes are so bad, and
    you’re so nearsighted till you can’t see nothing but your big building here and your big fine
    congregation, and your…the mayor of the city and all coming to your church, and you got the
    celebrity. And you forgot Me. But if you are that blind, and your eyes is that sore, I’ll sell you
    some eyesalve.” Yeah. 191 See, it’s strange them doctors of divinity didn’t have any of that, isn’t
    it? They had a lot of perfume, had a lot of theology. BUT THEY NEEDED EYESALVE,
    GOD’S HOLY SPIRIT, TO MASSAGE THEIR EYES AND LET THEM LOOK FOR THE
    COMING OF THE LORD, LET THEM LOOK AT THE BIBLE, LET THEM LOOK AT
    THE WORD. They know how to say “ah-man” just exactly right. They had the perfume, they
    had all the ointments. But, “They needed eyesalve,” the Lord said. Said, “You need a little
    salve to go on your eyes, and it’ll open them up.”
    Elijah told... when Jezebel killed Naboth, to give the vineyard to Ahab. And Ahab…
    She told Ahab said, "Rise up and go down and take the vineyard because Naboth is dead." And
    when Ahab went down to possess the vineyard...
    And that is exactly what is going to happen, in this hour; that’s exactly what’s repeating,
    in this hour. They’re goin to try to take the vineyard of God's people, in this hour, through the
    World Council of Churches. They’re going to shut your doors, that you can't preach. They are
    gonna have a Federal execution set up and will kill you on the spot.

    9 And remember, God is looking to me to see that I stay in the Word. And I’m looking to you to
    see that you carry out the Word, see, see, in this church. And keep it spiritual, for, remember, all
    the forces of—of the dark kingdom of Satan will be turned against you as you begin to grow in
    the Lord. And you must be soldiers, not just fresh recruits. You’re aged soldiers now, and been
    trained to fight. And Satan will come among you, cause you to dispute with one another if he
    can. Turn him down just immediately; you’re brethren; and it’s the enemy. And we’re here to
    hold a standard in this evening Light time, that, when the world is darkened and the whole
    church kingdom is going into the Council of Churches. And pretty soon they’ll try to tack a sign
    on this door here, “Closed!” And then we’re going to have to meet other places, ’cause they’ll
    certainly close these churches one of these days if we don’t take the mark of the beast. And
    we’re depending on staying true to God till death sets us free, and that’s what we intend to do.
    
     "Oh," you say, "Brother Lambert, you’re beside yourself." I’m not beside myself. Elijah
    said it would be so and so shall it be. "Well, why aren't you preaching this out here where

    59
    everybody can hear you?" You know why? It is because, Brother, they don't like the message of
    a spiritual eunuch. They want somebody to come and tickle their ears and tell them what great
    Power they’re going to have with God.
    But, so saith God, "You’ll have no power, but you’ll reap destruction in the great
    tribulation and you’ll run to the rocks and the caves and cry for the rocks to hide you from the
    wrath of the Lamb of God," because you did not love the truth of God's great eunuch and
    prophet. Oh, don't worry, it is "line upon line and precept upon precept." It’s, "here a little and
    there a little," but it’s here.
    Revelation 6:16-17-Reference quote:
    16 And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth
    on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb:
    17 For the great day of his wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand?
    Isaiah 28:9-10-Reference quote:
    9 Whom shall he teach knowledge? and whom shall he make to understand doctrine? them that
    are weaned from the milk, and drawn from the breasts.
    10 For precept must be upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here
    a little, and there a little:
    And when old Ahab went down to take the vineyard of God's chosen people, he tried to
    buy it. And he wouldn’t sell it. That’s the way with God's people, they won't sell out. They’ll
    keep the covenant that God gave them. They won't sell out like old Esau did.
    Matthew 13:45-46-Reference quote:
    45 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls:

    62 Unless you are deeply sincere! And you cannot be sincere until you’re positive understand. If
    you’re presuming, or guessing, or hoping so, then there cannot be a depths of sincerity that God
    requires. It, faith, is not a “hope so” or “it could be right.” It’s got to be absolutely “Amen!”
    It’s your ultimate. It—it—it’s your—it’s your absolute. It’s the thing that you’re tied to. See? You
    have come to your ultimate, that “It is the Truth and there’s…It’s nothing but the truth, and It
    must be thus!” And then when you realize that in your mind, then you’ve got to approach It with
    your whole life, soul, body, all that’s in you, just completely sell out everything to it. As Jesus so
    graciously taught us in the man buying pearls, and he found the One of great price and he sold
    all his others to get to It. All the truths and everything that he had, though they were good
    pearls, he—he…this One meant all to him. And when you find God’s Ultimate, His Word, a
    promise upon a certain thing, you must know first that it is God’s Word, that the thing that
    you’re seeing being done is God. There—there’s no—there’s no “maybe so, it could be, it

    60
    looks like it might be.” “It is God!” Then when you get to that spot, then that’s the Pearl of
    great price, you must get away from anything that anybody else tells you contrary to It. You
    must not look to what man has achieved. You must look to what God has said and what He
    promised, and see Him to do it, then that’s your Ultimate right there. And then everything that
    you are, everything that you was, everything that you hope to be, must be placed upon This
    just as though it was death and life to you at that moment.
    But when they went down to possess the vineyard, that…When he went down said, "Oh,
    finally got it, isn't it beautiful? Isn't this a beautiful vineyard?" And about that time, in walked the
    spiritual eunuch. And he walked in and he said, "Oh, thou my enemy, you found me." Said,
    "Yes, I found you. Because thou has perverted the way of the Lord and because that you
    killed Naboth, the dogs will lick your blood. The same place that you cast his body, the dogs will
    eat your blood."
    1 Kings 21:19-20-Reference quote:
    9 And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the Lord, Hast thou killed, and also taken
    possession? And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the Lord, In the place where dogs
    licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick thy blood, even thine.
    20 And Ahab said to Elijah, Hast thou found me, O mine enemy? And he answered, I have found
    thee: because thou hast sold thyself to work evil in the sight of the Lord.
    And there was Jehu standing in front of the palace and fulfilling the execution of God's
    spiritual eunuch, Elijah. And he said, "Who is on my side? Let him throw this wicked thing
    down to the ground." And there was three spiritual eunuchs raised up and threw her to the
    ground. Why, Brother? They did not have no seed. Her beauty could not entice them. They did
    not have any seed. She was knocking on the wrong door.
    And so is that World Council of Churches, out here. When they come to compromise to
    get the spiritual eunuchs in this hour, and the Queen Esther to compromise to the beauty of the
    World Council of Churches, they won't do it. It is because they don't have any will of their own;
    they don't have any seed of their own. They’ll turn it down, and cast that Jezebel to the ground
    with the word of the living God. Amen!
    Those three eunuchs threw her down because she could not tantalize them in any way;
    they was so sold out to God. And it was the spiritual eunuch, they had no seed to plant, so they
    destroyed Jezebel.
    Even so was the word of God, so, so “line upon line” that when Jehu went into the
    palace to get something to eat and said, "Go bury that wicked woman." And the eunuchs went
    out to bury her and came back and said, "There is nothing left of her, but her skull and but her
    feet. The dogs hath eaten her flesh." And Jehu said, "Uh-huh" said, "That is the Word of the
    Elijah, the Tishbite, the servant of the Lord." Because he spoke it, that the dogs will eat the flesh
    of Jezebel.
    And so is it, in this hour, Elijah said it would be and so shall it be. God will pour his
    wrath out upon her in the Great Tribulation and shall destroy her with the brightness of his
    coming, through the mouth of the Bride. God will confound the church world through the mouth

    61
    of Esther the Bride, in this hour because the Bride hath made herself ready and her body is
    prepared to be presented to Christ.

    people. I’m identified with Him in His ministry at this day. Glory to God! I’m identified with
    Him, for deliverance in this last days. I trust to be a part of that great Bride that’s coming some
    of these days. 179 No matter what the world may say, they may call us “crazy, hysterical, or
    Beelzebubs, or heretics,” whatever they want to be. I still want to be identified with that group.
    I’m still there. I’m remain there. I was born there. I want to stay there. I’ll always be there,
    ’cause God placed me there. I am. I left my church, to come identify myself with a bunch of holyrollers. I’m one of them. I’m identified with them. They say, “Billy, you lost your mind.” 180
    Maybe I did, but I found the mind of Christ. I found His Word, found His Presence, found that
    He’s the same yesterday, today, and forever!…care what anybody else thinks about it. This is
    me. I’m the one that has to make my identification. I’m identified with Him, by God’s Word. He
    said, “These signs shall follow them that believe.” I’m glad I’m identified in that. Yes, sir. 181

    You know, the old master violinist, one time. You’ve heard the story. They had an old violin and
    auctioned it off. They wanted to sell it, and nobody would buy it. They said, “Who will give a
    dollar? Who will give a dollar and a half?” Finally, “Going once, going twice, a dollar and a
    half.” 182 Finally an old gray-haired man stepped out of the audience. You know the story.
    Picked it up, said, “Let me have it.” Put some rosin on his bow, and struck it a few times. The
    people begin to weep. The tears began to run off their faces, like that. 183 And when they did, the
    auctioneer picked up again, said, “Who will make one,” said, “thousand dollars, two thousand,
    five thousand?” 184 What was the difference? The master, the one who knew it, the one who
    built it, he knowed how to get out of it what was in it. 185 And as long as we try to bring our
    churches out of creeds and denominations, we’ll never do it. Let the Master Builder of
    mankind, Who made man in His own image, Who is building Him a Bride for the same thing,
    let His bow stroke of the Holy Ghost strike this Word in your heart one time, and it’ll be our
    best example. No matter how many big churches you go to, and how many names is on the book,
    it’ll do more for Jesus Christ than all the churches, and denominations, and creeds, and world
    churches, and organizations, in all the world. 186 He is making a Bride. Yes, sir. He’s hewing
    the chips now, chopping off the world. Oh, church-joining, and creeds, and denominations, and
    dogmas, all has to be cut away from the Church; their formal ideas, their indifference, their
    doctrines and things. Come back and let the Master pick up the bow. Let the Master pick you
    up in His hands, strike the Word, say, “Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever.”
    187 Say, “Amen, Lord. Make me, mold me, make me, Lord, what I should be.” Then there’ll
    be a different thing. 188 Then, “If I be lifted up from the earth, I’ll draw all men unto Me.”
    Yes, sir. 189 He is cutting you out now, cutting you down to His Word only, cutting all the
    creeds and dogmas and everything, away from you, trying to get back to a Bride for the Son,
    another masterpiece, part of the Word. The Word! 190 Jesus couldn’t take the place. You
    remember when they read that day in the book? He read just part of the prophecy, left the rest of
    it for the last day. We’re supposed to take that part. 191 So, you see, He has cut, wants to cut
    the Church out, just like He did the Son out, like He did the Bride and the Groom. To be His
    Bride, you must be part of Him. Not part of the creed, not part of the church, not part of the
    denomination, but the part of Him. Hewed out of any other kind of a form, won’t work. You
    got to be hewed from the Word. The world cut off of you, and just leave the Word only live in
    you. 192 THE GREAT SCULPTOR IS COUNTING ON YOU, WILLING TO STAND AND
    HAVE YOURSELF SHAPED INTO THE LIKENESS OF HIS REQUIREMENT THAT HIS
    WORD REQUIRES. “IN THE LAST DAYS I’LL POUR OUT MY SPIRIT UPON ALL
    FLESH. YOUR SONS AND DAUGHTERS SHALL PROPHESY.” CHRIST IS THE
    IDENTIFIED MASTERPIECE OF THE WORD MADE FLESH. YOU ARE ASKED TO
    IDENTIFY YOURSELF IN HIM, BY THE SAME WORD, TO BE THE MASTERPIECE
    FOR THE BRIDE. 193 NOW, BRETHREN, GOD HAD A MASTERPIECE THEN, TO
    PRESENT TO THE WORLD, NOW HE WANTS A MASTERPIECE TODAY. Are you
    willing? Are you ready, my Christian friend? Are you really sure that your life is so reflecting for
    Christ, no matter what the world says. They say, “You lost your mind. You gone crazy. You went
    and joined that bunch of holy-rollers.” Don’t you pay no attention to that. 194 If you’re not
    really truly saved, and in that Body, and the Word of God in you and reflecting Itself, and the
    Life of Christ reflecting out of you; brother, sister, don’t you take that chance. I don’t care what
    you are, what kind of an experiences you have, LET THAT WORD REFLECT THROUGH
    YOU EACH DAY, BECAUSE GOD, IN THIS LAST DAYS, IS TAKING A BRIDE FOR HIS
    SON, JESUS CHRIST.

    And when the Headstone comes and meets the Bride, the Body, Jesus Christ will

    But watch, the Church that goes right out to the end of it, right out at the end of that, that
    Church is going to have to be so perfectly like the ministry of Jesus Christ, till when that stone
    comes, it sets right smack in the groove. Oh, Hallelujah! Oh. 118 If you can catch it and know
    what I’m talking about, the very ministry that Jesus Christ was doing here on earth, when it
    comes back, the very same ministry He had, Pentecost will not have to widen itself out in
    organization, but shape itself up in Christ until the Headstone and the Church will fit one to
    the other. And them is so cemented, till you can’t even take a razor blade and go around and
    find the crack where they were put together. And that’s how the Church is got to come, so
    much like Christ. And look what we got to do then. Cut away and circumcise and chop off, and
    form and molded into the image of Jesus Christ until that Church and the Cap comes right
    smack together. 119 Look at my hand on a shadow on the wall. When it’s away from me, it’s
    scattered out. As it comes, it becomes more closer. There’s not a great big fingers, it’s getting
    smaller and smaller and smaller, getting darker and darker and darker, until the shadow, the
    negative and the positive becomes one. And that’s the way it is in the Coming, the Church has
    got to shape itself till it hasn’t got a spot or wrinkle in it. Amen. There is that second Bible.
    
     Brother, it has to be. You can't get out of it. I would talk to anybody on the Bible. If
    they could show me anything else in the Bible, I would like to see it. You can't do it. You can't
    do it because the Bible prophesied that this Church Age would end in apostasy. And to end in
    apostasy, dear Brother, if you’re a Bible student here, tonight, if you read your Bible, the word
    “apostasy” means rejecting present revealed truth. And there is only one thing left for apostasy
    and that is destruction. And there is only one thing left, there’s only one message left and that is
    a message of judgement. That’s all. A message of judgement. Over in Isaiah 56:4, to those that
    desire to be a spiritual eunuch, tonight….
    Isaiah 56:4-5-Reference quote:
    4 For thus saith the Lord unto the eunuchs that keep my sabbaths, and choose the things that
    please me, and take hold of my covenant;
    5 Even unto them will I give in mine house and within my walls a place and a name better
    than of sons and of daughters: I will give them an everlasting name, that shall not be cut off.
    Let us just be real reverent, now, and bow our heads, as I close. If you got a seed of your
    own, I beg of you... If you got a will of your own, in this life, you want to do this and you want
    to do that. Have you got a seed of your own? Wouldn't you want to be a spiritual eunuch for
    Christ, and just say what Christ said?

    64
    Brother, I’d rather live on soda crackers and black-eyed peas or anything than eat steak
    every day and preach in one of these Jezebel houses or run out ahead of God in some tent
    meeting. You want to be a spiritual eunuch for Jesus Christ, you only want to say what the King
    said. Say, "It is written; it is written; it is written; I believe the word of Elijah. I believe the word
    of Elijah."
    Let me just... with your heads bowed, let me tell you what God said. If you, you want to
    be a spiritual eunuch, he said to his eunuchs that keep his covenant, his word, he would give a
    name to them better than of sons and daughters, a name better than son and daughters. "And I
    will give them an everlasting name." Oh, my Friend, what precious, tender words of promise. He
    would give us an everlasting name, that would be better than the names of sons and
    daughters. Can you comprehend what kind of a name is this? It’s a new name. It’s a new name to
    those that will overcome in this hour. The only way that you can... It does not make any
    difference of what it is to overcome. But how can you overcome? The only way that you can
    overcome, is take this word, this unadulterated word of God.
    Revelation 2:17-Reference quote:
    17 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that
    overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the
    stone a new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it.

    32 And in this stone was “a name,” a name that no one knowed but the one who received it
    himself. He knew it, but no one else could know it but him. So when you hear these guy’s flatter
    you, telling theirs; they’re “John,” they’re “Paul,” they’re “Mary,” they’re “this,” “that,” or
    the “other.” Don’t you believe it, ’cause if it was, he’d never say nothing about it. See? That’s
    right. He has to keep it to hisself. He knowed. No one knowed but he himself, but he knowed
    because every perfect overcomer receives a new name in that—that—that way. 33 Did you notice
    Abraham was called Abram, but when God went to use him, He changed his name to
    “Abraham.” S-a-r-r-a was Sarra, but when God was going to use her, He changed her name to
    S-a-r-r-a-h: Sarah, “princess.” Do you know that Jacob…? Jacob was “supplanter.” Esau
    means “red,” hairy and red; red-headed, and red all over, is Esau. Now, and Jacob was
    “supplanter.” And supplanter is a “deceiver.” Didn’t Esau say, “Isn’t his name called Jacob,
    ‘supplanter’?” But when he wrestled with the Lord all night long, and overcome, and was
    blessed, God changed his name; Jacob to Israel, “a prince with God.” Paul was called Saul
    until he met the Holy Spirit in the form of a Light that shined down upon him, his name was
    changed from Saul to “Paul.” Simon, when he met Jesus, He changed his name to “Peter.”
    That… 34 And when Jesus overcome, His Name was changed. And He would reveal that
    Name, “He that would be with Him, overcome as He has, he received a new name; and I’ll
    reveal My new Name to him.” See? And every overcomer, I mean, among such as that: them
    leaders and so forth. Now, all the children of Israel didn’t get their name changed, of course.
    That’s right. But those high leaders, when they overcome, they had received a new name. See
    how it dovetails in? Just perfectly. 35 And now we find out that he also got “hidden manna.”
    Now, hidden manna is typed to the shewbread. The shewbread was for priests alone. That is

    65
    right. Shewbread was just for the priest. And they…It was a special thing made for the priest,
    that is, the leaders; and this man overcome. The whole congregation got manna, but he got a
    hidden (special) manna, OR A “SPECIAL REVELATION,” OH, OF WHO JESUS WAS, and
    what about Him, all about Him. See, he got that revelation if he had overcome, to the angel.
    “Hold fast, for he that…” He had overcome.
    Now, with every head bowed, I am getting ready to pray for you. Brothers and Sisters, if
    you’ve been wishy-washy in the revelation of the word and you want to kind of, compromise a
    little bit with it, won't you make that right with God, tonight? And say, like the Apostle Paul
    said, "If an angel would come from heaven and preach any other gospel than what he preached,
    let him be accursed." And you want to make your stand in this way of truth that is so evilly
    despised, in this hour.
    Galatians 1:8-Reference quote:
    8 But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which
    we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.
    Oh, how glad you’ll be that you listened to these words, tonight, on the day
    of judgement, Friend. Oh, how glad you’ll be that you took the way of God's eunuchs. Won't you
    prepare your body? Won't you help prepare each one of us, as members in particular, in the Body
    of Christ. Some may be a toe, a finger, a nose or an eye or a hand or whatever it is. But Brother,
    Sister, you need to prepare your body. God’s got everything that you need right here in His
    promises, preached to you by His eunuchs.
    I want to pray, now, close the meeting out. Won't you get something that’s anchored
    down in your heart, today, tonight, that’ll stand upon this word of God and say like Jehu said,
    "Who is on my side, let him throw these doctrines down that is not of God." Who would like to
    slip up your hand? Nobody looking around you. God bless you, my Brother. God bless you,
    Sister. God bless you. God bless you back there, Sister. God bless you, Sister and you
    Sister. God bless your heart. You want to believe the word of God. All right, let us pray.

   We’re here tonight for one reason, not to play church, but to get closer to Jesus Christ and

   142 But we’re here to the spot now. The Gentiles of that day failed to see It, because It was in
   human flesh. I wonder if we’ll do the same thing. I wonder if we’ll make the sad mistake that
   they did, fail to know Him? Because, He was, He the Word for that age, was identified in a
   human body.
   Now, there’s many people in the land, they want to know the Lord Jesus without his
   word, they want to know him without his word. And many say, "Oh, how I love the Lord Jesus
   Christ!" And when it comes to lining up with the word, they’re unable to do it. But really the

   209 How you going to build your church upon the Rock? How will the preacher ever stand in the
   pulpit and preach the Rock, and build it upon the fundamentals of the full Gospel, when his
   
   2
   audience, some of his people out there, would put him out? Now, I blame the preacher for not
   having the audacity, and the Spirit of God, for just shutting the door, say, “Get somebody else
   will stand for that stuff and not me.” I—I admire a preacher that would do that. 210 But woe
   unto that congregation when an anointed man of God tries to bring them the Word, and then
   they won’t line up with It. That’s right. How is he going to have a church that all the nine gifts
   operating in it, and so forth, and then, they and that, and the church won’t even—even live
   decently and morally, won’t learn their ABC’s of the Gospel? Then say, “If I had a better
   preacher!” Why, it’s your fault. That’s right.
   
   Now, many, many people can cry when they see the sun go down, cause they have that

   movie and just cry all through the movie or they can hear somebody sing over a record and sit
   and cry and cry. But when they come to hear the word of God, they get just as bored as can be
   and couldn't shed a tear.

   61-1112 - A True Sign That's Overlooked
   William Marrion Branham
   37 And sometimes the torture that that sign has to go through is amazing. The torture that
   Jesus went through, to prove the sign of God, that He was the Messiah. 38 We find out here,
   this young prophet by the name of Ezekiel constantly became a sign, all the time. How he
   tortured himself! One place here we find where he laid on his left side for three hundred and
   ninety days. God told him to get some beans and some pottage, put it all together, cook it up, and
   lay it down by his side. And go lay on a tile, and lay on his left side, alone; not turn over, for
   three hundred and ninety days. Think of it. And then said, “Turn over on the right side and lay
   there forty days, again.” 39 And He said here, “What you see, Ezekiel,” said, “because you are
   bearing the iniquity of the people, each day will I count a year for them.” Being, that, every day
   he laid there, that meant a year they’d be in captivity, and that their iniquities would be
   remembered to God, and God would not hear their prayers no more. 40 But the torture that that
   man had to go through, why would that be necessary? Many has wondered, why would such a
   thing be necessary for a man to do. It’s because that people won’t read the Word, and they
   won’t pray. So, God is sovereign, and He sends His prophet to be a sign. The people won’t
   read. They don’t care to read. And they won’t pray, because they’re too…got other things to
   do. They can’t take time to pray. And the Bible is boresome to them. It hasn’t got enough
   action for these modern days, or any days.
   But the Bible said, "The entrance of Thy Word giveth life,” joy, O Lord.
   Psalm 119:130-Reference quote:
   130 The entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple.

   You see now, if you’re really born again of the Spirit of God, and you really have the true

   And if He isn’t infinite, then He isn’t God. See? So we must remember that we’re not dealing
   with something in—in time and space like we are, finite. We’re dealing with something that’s
   infinite. And if this is the Word of God, then it’s just as infinite as God is infinite. See?
   There you are. You must have faith in the Word. That’s the only way it’ll work. 10 And
   God’s Word is a Seed. And you farmers here, you know if you put a seed in the ground and
   take care of it right, if it’s in the right kind of ground, it’ll produce what the seed is. And
   God’s Word is a Seed. And if you put It in the right kind of ground of faith, and treat it
   right, it’ll produce just what it—it is. If it’s for healing, it’ll produce healing; salvation,
   salvation; joy, joy. And every promise in the Bible is true. And just remember; you can take
   me to record for this: That the right mental attitude towards any Divine promise of God
   will bring it to pass, if you can take the right attitude towards that promise. Now, the Bible
   said, “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was
   God. And the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us.” Then if the Word was God, then
   It is still God. 11 Now, no man is better than his word. If you can’t take my word, then I—I
   would never be a—could be a friend to you. And if I couldn’t take your word, I could not
   trust you. But when we can take one another at our word, believing you… Now, that’s the
   way you do God. And no man’s better than his word. If you make a promise, you should
   always keep it, or tell the reason why you can’t and let them know, because a man’s word is
   his bond. And God’s Word is His Bond. If God doesn’t keep His Word, then it isn’t the
   Word of God. But if He does keep His Word, then He’s God in His Word. God is still in
   His Word. And when His Word comes in you, then your word becomes His Word; that’s
   what brings it to pass, whatever you’ve asked. Just as simple as that.
   
   And many, many, when it comes to the sharp cutting edge of the sword... No joy but
   sadness. It proves that we need, right then, to check and see what is the matter. That should prove
   to us right there that something is the matter, that no matter how hard the word is, if you have the
   right kind of a spirit, it should produce joy.
   So, if... Now, I don't know that I would, but if I would say something to offend you and it
   is in the word, then, if it brings sadness to you, then make your calling and election sure. Just
   check it.

   Scripture and see if it’s a promise of God, then check it by the Word.
   
   We need to check every motive in this day that we’re living in. We should check every
   motive and everything that comes to us that would, under the design that we think it would be
   the Holy Spirit showing unto us, we should check it by the word because we’re living in the most

   And the powers of Satan is—is many times harder to fight against than it was in any age. See?
   Here! 45 Back there in early ages, a Christian could, for his profession of being a church…of
   belonging to Christ, could be beheaded for it. He could be killed, and put out of his misery, and
   go to meet God, quickly. But now the enemy has come in, in the name of the church, and it’s
   so deceiving. This is the great age of deception. When, Christ said so, “The two spirits would
   be so close in the last days till it would deceive the very Elected if it was possible.” See? See?
   See? Remember, Christ spoke of an elected people for the last day. See? “It would deceive the
   very Elected if it were possible.” So close! The people so live, people can live a clean, holy life;
   not be sinful, adulterers, and drinkers, and liars, gamblers. They can live above that, and still
   not with It. 46 THIS IS THE—THE AGE OF LIFE, PERSONAL LIFE OF CHRIST,

   we read.

   An Exposition Of The Seven Church Ages - 1 - The Revelation Of Jesus Christ
   William Marrion Branham
   How did Abel know what to do in order to offer a proper sacrifice to God? By faith he received
   the revelation of the blood. Cain didn’t get such a revelation (even though he had a
   commandment) so he couldn’t offer the right sacrifice. It was a revelation from God that made
   the difference and gave Abel eternal life. Now you might take what the pastor says, or what the
   seminary teaches, and though it might be taught to you with eloquence, until God reveals to you
   that Jesus is the Christ, and that it is the blood that cleanses you, and that God is your Saviour,
   you will never have eternal life. It is the Spiritual revelation that does it. Now I said that this
   Book of Revelation is the revelation of Jesus and what He is doing in the churches for those
   seven ages. It is a revelation because the disciples, themselves, didn’t know these recorded
   truths. It had not been previously revealed to them. You remember that they came to Jesus in the
   Book of Acts and asked Him, “Are You at this time going to restore the kingdom to Israel?” And
   He said, “It is not for you to know the times or the seasons.” Those men were still thinking of
   Jesus having an earthly kingdom. But it was a spiritual kingdom that He was going to build.
   Even He could not tell them about His place in it, for the Father had not revealed it unto Him.
   But now after His death and resurrection, and at this particular time in His mediatorial ministry,
   He is able to set forth here in this revelation of Himself to John what His glory and presence in
   the church would mean and do. In this revelation He tells us what the end of the devil is. He tells
   how He is going to deal with the devil and cast him into the lake of fire. He reveals the end of the
   wicked ones who follow Satan. And Satan hates that. Have you ever noticed how Satan hates two
   books of the Bible more than all others? Through liberal theologians and pseudo-scientists he is
   always attacking the Book of Genesis and the Book of Revelation. In both of these books we find
   Satan’s origin, his awful ways and his destruction. That is why he attacks them. He hates to be
   exposed, and in those books he is exposed for exactly what he is. Jesus said about Satan, “He
   has no part in Me, and I have no part in him.” The devil would like to prove that different; but he
   cannot, so he does all he can to destroy confidence in the Word. But when the church disbelieves
   Satan and believes the Spirit’s revelation of the Word, the gates of hell cannot prevail against
   her. Let me just put in a word here from my own ministry, if you don’t mind. You all know that
   this gift in my life is supernatural. It is a gift whereby the Holy Spirit is able to discern diseases,
   and the thoughts of men’s hearts, and other hidden things that only God could know and then
   reveal to me. I wish you could stand with me and see the faces of people when Satan knows he is
   going to be exposed. Now, it isn’t the people that I am talking about. It is that Satan has got a
   hold in their lives through sin, indifference, and disease. But you should see their faces. Satan
   knows he is going to be exposed, and the most peculiar changes come over the peoples’
   countenances. Satan is afraid. He knows that the Spirit of God is about to let the people know
   of his works. That is why he hates these meetings so much. When names are called and diseases
   revealed, Satan hates it. Now what is this? It is not mind reading, it is not telepathy, nor is it
   witchcraft. It is a REVELATION by the Holy Ghost. That is the only way I can know it. Of
   course the carnal mind will call it anything but the Holy Ghost. Let me show you another
   reason why Satan hates this Book of the Revelation of Jesus Christ in the church. He knows
   that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, and today, and forever, and He changes not. He knows
   that a whole lot more than do ninety percent of the theologians. He knows that since God is
   
   6
   immutable in His nature, then He is just as immutable in His ways. Thus Satan knows assuredly
   that the original church at Pentecost with the power of God (Mark 16 in action) is the True
   Church that Jesus claims as His own. All else is false. It has to be. Now remember this. Christ in
   the True Church is a continuation of the Book of Acts. But the Book of Revelation shows how
   that the antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it, making it lukewarm, formal
   and powerless. It exposes Satan, revealing his works (attempted destruction of God’s people
   and the discrediting of God’s Word) right down to the time he is cast into the lake of fire. He
   fights that. He cannot stand it. He knows that if the people get the TRUE REVELATION of
   the TRUE CHURCH and what she is, what she stands for and that SHE CAN DO THE
   GREATER WORKS, SHE WILL BE AN INVINCIBLE ARMY. IF THEY GET A TRUE
   REVELATION OF THE TWO SPIRITS WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE
   CHRISTIAN CHURCH, AND BY GOD’S SPIRIT DISCERN AND WITHSTAND THE
   ANTICHRIST SPIRIT, SATAN WILL BE POWERLESS BEFORE HER. He will be as
   definitely thwarted today as when CHRIST WITHSTOOD HIS EVERY EFFORT TO GAIN
   POWER OVER HIM IN THE DESERT. YES, SATAN HATES REVELATION. BUT WE
   LOVE IT. WITH TRUE REVELATION IN OUR LIVES, THE GATES OF HELL CANNOT
   PREVAIL AGAINST US, BUT WE WILL PREVAIL OVER THEM.
   
   
   Now, I am just talking now, I’m not preaching I’m trying to get into the mood to
   preach. You pray for me cause, I told brother Barney I just wasn't going to preach tonight. When
   me and Barney got to working today and ended up, it was six something before we got through.
   And then I had a call from New York City, an hour and a half, and I heard so many
   spiritual things over the phone, I was so nervous by the time I got through over the phone, boy, I
   just had to lay down. I took a cold shower and laid down and prayed to God to sure help me
   tonight. So, you pray for me Brothers, you minister Brothers and all of you that I might say
   something to help the little Bride here tonight.
   Now, if we will just bow our heads before we break God's Word.
   Brother Lambert gives opening Prayer:
   Our Dear Heavenly Father, we come here tonight, Lord, many of us are weary and tired
   in body, and Lord, some of us have burdens and trials and tribulations that we’re going through,
   but, Oh Lord God, thou art able tonight, Lord, to refresh us by the holy spirit. Thou art able to
   strengthen us and encourage us, Lord, and show us where we’re living at and what’s ready to
   take place in your word, Lord.
   God, thou art able to meet every need here tonight by your riches in glory, Lord, through
   the Cross of Calvary. Oh God, bless your word now, Lord, and bless us as we sit here together
   tonight around the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ. In Jesus' Name I pray for myself, Lord. Give
   me strength in my nervous system and my body, Lord. Help me to say something that would be
   of benefit to your kingdom and to your people, Lord, in Jesus name, amen.
   I certainly won't be able without the help of God to do this little thought here any justice
   at all, but I’m gonna... what I had felt... kinda preach to you tonight. I’d like to speak to you on
   the, "The Man-Child," "The Man-Child Made Manifested in this hour."
   Now if you’ll open your bibles, to the first book of Samuel. I would like for Brother

   1 Samuel 1:6-Scripture Reading:
   1 Now there was a certain man of Ramathaimzophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name was
   Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite:
   2 And he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah:
   and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.
   3 And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the Lord of hosts in
   Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the Lord, were there.
   4 And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons
   and her daughters, portions:
   5 But unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah: but the Lord had shut up her
   womb.
   6 And her adversary also provoked her sore, for to make her fret, because the Lord had shut up
   her womb.
   Thank you, my brother. May God add a blessing to the reading of His Word.
   Now, I would like to type here, in a little bit of typology, if you please, as Hannah, as the Bride
   for this hour. And I’d like to type her adversary, this other wife of her husband, as the
   Pentecostal church, the so-called Bride of the Lord. Amen.
   And I’d like for you to notice here that Hannah was the bride that her…was the bride that
   her husband loved very dearly. He loved her very dearly, and he gave a portion to the other wife,
   but unto Hannah, he gave a double portion. Now I’d like for you to notice Hannah, here a
   moment. And remember now, I am applying that to the Bride of this hour.
   Now, in this hour that Hannah was living in, as she went up to the church to do worship
   to God. We find out that the priesthood was polluted. It was polluted and they were doing things
   that were so terrible and so wicked, that the Bible said that men abhorred the offering of the Lord
   because of the priesthood, because of the two sons of Eli, which were named Hophni and
   Phinehas. And the offering of the Lord was polluted, and they abhorred the offering of the Lord.
   And if that isn't a very picture of the priesthood today. The priesthood is so corrupted
   today; it is so immoral today; it’s so bound down with this Laodicean spirit that is upon the
   church. They have sold out to denominations, they sold out to popularity, they sold out to
   materialism. And it seems as though, that to come into the House of the Lord today is a horrible
   thing. And many sincere people are staying home tonight, is because of the gospel tents that goes
   forth into the land today. When they see the corruption of this so-called Eli Priesthood today that
   it seems, as said in the Bible then, that the offering and the services of the Lord were abhorred by
   the people because of the wickedness of this Eli Priesthood.
   I’d like for you to just look at this Eli Priesthood, out here today, that claims to be the
   Voice of God and that claims to have the deliverance for God's people and that claims to have
   the answer for this hour. If it isn't a very picture of that Eli Priesthood, I’d like to know what is
   it?
   Listen, that Eli Priesthood was allotted so much meat. Now the offering of the Lord in
   those days was what kind of an offering you could afford. If it was a lamb or an oxen or
   whatever it was that you could afford, you brought that to the priesthood and they slayed this
   sacrifice and went through the law that Moses commanded in Leviticus.
   
   8
   But we find that this priesthood was so corrupted, it wasn't satisfied with just the tenth of
   the meat that God had allotted them to supply their need, their food and everything. But that Eli
   Priesthood, they had a prong that they stuck down in this boiling pot and pulled out whatever that
   prong got a hold of and pulled it out, that was their portion.
   But I want you to know that they wasn’t satisfied with the portion that God gave
   them. They had to go and take it away from the people that was offering it. And if that isn't a
   very picture of these adulterous churches out here today. It’s money, money, money,
   money. They’re not satisfied with the tenth that God gave them. It’s, "Sell your farm and give it
   to God's servant. Sell this and give it to God's servant." And if they don't do that, then they bring
   a curse upon you. A very picture of the Eli Ministry in that day.

   William Marrion Branham
   7 I’ve noticed to… When I first started, and I knew there’d be a lot hooked up with this, and
   there’s nobody on the field in them days. And me being a Baptist and coming out amongst Full
   Gospel people, I realized what it was going to be. And there was three things that I noticed in the
   Bible that always…?… a minister. And one of them was money, and the other one was
   popularity, and women. So I know that Saul fell because of popularity, Balaam because of
   money, and Samson because of women. So then I know those three things was a hindrance that
   we must always keep covered up. And money of course, would be the—the greatest. And… or
   trying to think you’re just a little better than somebody else. 8 I—I tried, Christian friends, tried
   my best; by God’s grace I can say with His grace, all of it’s been in the background. You pray
   that I can keep it that way. I never took money. I suppose that… Billy told me a few minutes ago,
   said, “Daddy, I think they took you up a love offering.” That wasn’t necessary, didn’t have to do
   that. I never come for that purpose; God knows that. No, sir. I’m a poor man, could have been a
   multi-millionaire. Many of you knows that I was give at one time one million five hundred
   thousand dollars at one time. When the agents brought it to me, I refused to look at their order; I
   said, “No, sir, I wouldn’t put my hand on it.” 9 They said, “Oh, my,” said, “but this man’s worth
   twenty-eight million dollars. He owns a big Mission Bell Winery and all.” I said, “I don’t care
   what he owns, sir; my Father owns the cattle of every hill and He… I—I don’t have any need of
   the money.” And he said, “Well, I was just seeing your mother’s home and yours here, the
   parsonage,” and said, “you could use it.” I said, “Yes, when I need it, Father will send it to me.
   But I—I don’t need it now.”

   56-1125E - A Blushing Prophet
   William Marrion Branham
   71 Sin among the Christians, among the Elect! They’ve sold their birthrights out, for
   popularity. The minister has swapped the Gospel for a social party. He has swapped the oldfashion Blood-washed Gospel for intellectual with the people, to preach intellect, talk of
   society, and mis-use the Gospel. Many of them has went out into the fields, a preaching, and
   used the Gospel for personal gain, to make money. Many of them has got big barns and cars,
   
   9
   and things that they never would have had, personal gain. Not all; I’m thankful that there is still
   a remnant.
   And I believe Hannah, as she journeyed many miles with her husband and as the other
   Christians of that hour, if you please, as they journeyed down to worship God at Shiloh, I can
   imagine how they felt. It was hardly worth coming down there for. And many of the tent
   ministries that you go in today that claims to be the Voice of God, if you got any spirit at all in
   you and any word of God in you, it just makes you sick to your stomach. It makes you sick to
   your stomach. And yet they go right on.
   But, I imagine that Hannah was burdened about the whole thing. I would of imagine that
   she got alone with the Lord, and she began to pray and she began to seek God. She began to cry
   out to God over the terrible conditions of this Eli Priesthood, until she got so burdened about it,
   she was in desperation and she went up to the altar of the Lord. She fell down and began to
   travail and agonize that God would send a man-child, that God would give her a man-child that
   would stay with the word, and that would be faithful and that wouldn’t give into all of this
   pollution that was in the church at that time.
   And God, seeing the need of the hour, Glory to God, answered the prayer of
   Hannah. And in her desperation God spoke to her and gave her a son. And I want you to know
   that, that son was the word of God Made Manifested, a prophet, Samuel. Why, he was the
   unadulterated word of God. Whatever Samuel said, it never failed to come to pass.
   And I want you to know that when Samuel came on the scene, brother, the Eli ministry
   was doomed under the hand of God. It was doomed under the hand of God. Why? There come
   forth a manifestation of the Word of God. He was sincere; he was faithful to God; he stayed with
   the ministry that God had ordained for him to do.
   Now I want you to notice, that… that is what is in the need…that is the need of this hour
   today. If the Bride, Hannah, today, that claims to be the Bride, if she could get a burden for the
   pollution of the ministry and of the churches today, that she’d cry out to God, that God would
   give her a son...!
   Well, it was just like in the days when Jesus came on the scene, the priesthood was
   polluted. They had made merchandise out of God's house. They had turned down the ministry of
   John. And here, once again, at a time of great pollution in the priesthood, God, through Mary....
   I imagine Mary was burdened about the conditions of the priesthood and the temple as
   much as Hannah was and God answered her prayer and gave her a Man-child, Jesus. And when
   this Man-child, Jesus come on the scene, brother, that Eli Priesthood of His hour was doomed
   under the Word of God made manifested for that hour. IT WAS DOOMED.
   He said, you say that you have Abraham your father. You say it. But you are of your
   father the devil, and the works of your father you’ll do it! That’s what he said. Said, "You
   snakes, you vipers." It was doomed under the hand of God through that Man-child of that hour
   just like it was under the Man-child that Hannah gave birth to. It was doomed.

   Samuel to purge the floor of the Temple, brother. He began to purge it and the people began to
   see the change. And when Jesus came to be manifested by his Father in his temple, He walked in
   there with a cord and said, "Is it not written, my father's house shall be called a house of prayer
   and YOU HAVE MADE IT A DEN OF THIEVES." And so is it in this hour, brother. As Jannes
   and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these false Eli Priesthood of this hour, withstand the truth of
   Malachi four.

   9 But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be manifest unto all men, as theirs also
   was.
   I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT THERE’S ONLY ONE WAY OF TRUTH IN THIS
   HOUR. The Bible said, "There was a way of Truth and it shall be evil spoken of." I would like to
   prick your conscience for a minute. If you would please, brother and sisters, tell me what truth,
   one way of truth now, is it the Methodists? Are they evil spoken of? Is it the Baptists? Said,
   "There was a way of truth that was evil spoken of."
   2 Peter 2:1-2-Reference quote:
   1 But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers

   them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction.
   2 And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil
   spoken of.
   Said, this Eli ministry was reprobate. They were reprobate concerning the faith or the
   way of truth and they would speak evil of it, like Jannes and Jambres spoke evil against the
   message of Moses. I ask you a question now, just think a minute. Is it the Methodist, the way of
   truth? Is it the Baptist? A way now, only one way. Is it the Pentecostals?

   else working right in the church. Speak in tongues; as a man of God that was among us, the
   messenger for this hour said, "Drunk blood out of a skull, a human skull and prophesy and speak
   in tongues and give the interpretation of it." And they are resting their eternal life on speaking in
   tongues. Brother, you can speak in tongues and shout and jump up and down and that doesn't

   64-0319 - Calling Jesus On The Scene
   William Marrion Branham
   81 We need a Book of Acts again. But the only way you’ll do it is get back to the Bible, and away
   from some of this hybrid religion. 82 Hybreeding, have to be babied! No faith! Just a bunch of—
   of powder puffs, just sissified, babied into it. “I’m…” I say, are you a Christian? “I’m
   Methodist.” Are you a Christian? “I’m Presbyterian. I’m Pentecostal.” That don’t mean that, to
   God. [Brother Branham snaps his finger—Ed.] 83 You’re a Christian because you are born in
   the Spirit of Christ, and the Word of God lives in you. 84 You know, I always enjoy a high-bred
   horse. You know, he has got sense. You can—you can teach him things, do things for him, and
   he’ll learn. But you take an old mule, you can’t do nothing to him. He’s just a big old long-eared
   donkey. He sits there, and, you could talk to him, he’ll stick his ears out, and, “Huh? Huh?
   Huh?” See, that, he’s just a hybrid. 85 Puts in mind, a lot of these so-called Christians, hybrid,
   donkey religion. You tell them Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever; say, “I
   don’t believe It.” See? And so you can’t never teach him nothing. How can you teach him;
   
   12
   he’s gone, anyhow. “My church believes It this way. Mine believes It that way.” But God’s
   Word says He’s the same yesterday, today, and forever! I like not a hybrid Christian. 86 I like
   a—like a pedigreed horse. He knows who his papa was, who his mama was, who his grandpa
   and grandma was. He knows all the generations all the way back. 87 So does a pedigreed
   Christian, he knows Who his Father is. He come from God; He is the Word of God, He’s the
   same as He ever was. He’s a real pedigreed product of God, the Word of God is in him, Jesus
   Christ manifesting Himself. 88 Bunch of unbelievers! Jesus wanted to shake off a bunch of
   parasites one day, He had too many following Him. He had His disciples. Then, He had the
   seventy, the ministerial association. Then, He had the congregation, by the thousands. And then
   He made this statement, He said, “Except you eat the Blood…eat the flesh of the Son of man, and
   drink His Blood, you have no Life in you.”
   I want you to know that Balaam was a true... He had a true prophet’s ministry. Yes, he
   did. Every Word that he spoke came to pass and the Bible said, "If there be a prophet among
   you, what he speaks comes to pass, listen to him." And his prophecy is still ringing on now and
   is carried right over to the Jews, right now; but he was lost. Because, just like the other Eli
   Priesthood in that day, he sold out, like all the rest of them in this hour, to money. And the Bible
   said, "It would repeat in the end-time that the Eli Ministry would sell themselves for popularity
   and go into one big World Council of Churches." He said it, didn't he, Brother?
   And the Bible said, "There was 'a way' of Truth." I’d like for you to show me 'a way' of
   truth in Pentecost that’s evil spoken of. Even the Pope is getting ready to embrace
   Pentecost. Come on, now. Come on now. The Pope is getting ready to embrace
   Pentecost. Pentecost gave birth to more converts, the last two years than Catholicism ever
   thought about getting. Well, I want to ask you, like I asked that Church of Christ man; I said,
   "Would you please tell me where 'that way of truth' that’s evil spoken of? I want it go join it
   because that’s the one to join." Come on now.
   If you could find the people that is believing a message that is evil spoken of, then you...
   that’s vindicated, listen, it’s got to be vindicated. I traveled all over the land, and people say... a
   man of God would get up and say, "Glory to God, the Lord showed me, the Lord showed me
   this." And then I would like to say, I said, "Did He back it up by any power?" "No." Well, I said,
   "Every age that God had upon the earth, every church age, every message, every revelation that
   He sent forth was backed up by the Power of Jehovah God."
   Let me tell you something. You’re not obligated to believe a message that is not backed
   up by the vindicated Jehovah God. You can't show me a one of these Pentecostals... Now, you
   better be serious, because there is not only one kind of a people going in the rapture, and that is
   the ones that the Bible spoke of who were worshiping in the way that was evil spoken
   of. Because there was a broad way that leadeth to destruction, by this Eli Priesthood, and many
   would go in thereat.
   Revelation 13:8 and Revelation 17:8 said all that dwelt upon the face of earth, both bond
   and free, come on now, would receive the mark of this Eli Priesthood, except the ones that had
   their names put in the Lamb's Book of Life, slain from the foundation of the World.
   
   13
   Revelation 13:8-Reference quote:
   8 And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book
   of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.
   Revelation 17:8-Reference quote:
   8 The beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go
   into perdition: and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in
   the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that was, and is not,
   and yet is.
   I ask your conscience now; can you show me among the Pentecostals, a way, a message
   that’s been vindicated by God, a revelation on a message that has been vindicated by God that’s
   evil spoken of? You can't even name me... If I had a thousand dollars, I’ll give it to you tonight
   if you’ll name me one man that had a message that was vindicated. You can't do it, you can't do
   it!
   A man up there in the hospital, when we was seeking the Lord for a little boy that was
   going to have his leg cut off, and got in a debate right there. He wouldn't hold it to even
   listen. Just couldn't hold it in, he wanted to talk on the Bible. And said... and we asked him this
   same question. He said, "Why Oh, I know all kinds of them." I said, "Name one. Name one of
   them." "Why," he said, "There’s plenty of them." I said, "Name me one." And he had to back up,
   he couldn't do it. Neither can anybody else.
   But they’ll still go on speaking in tongues and shouting and jumping up and down and are
   blind about that Eli Priesthood in this hour. Oh Brother, you think of it. You talk about
   deception; you talk about moldy bread, as we preached on the other night. You remember that
   the Bible says, that, "Fear not little flock..." "As it was in the days of Noah, wherein eight souls
   were saved..."
   Luke 12:32-Reference quote:
   32 Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom.
   1 Peter 3:20-Reference quote:
   20 Which sometime were disobedient, when once the longsuffering of God waited in the days of
   Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by water.
   Come on now, they’re not going to be many make the rapture. You just settle that in your
   heart. Why? It's because of the deception of the Eli Priesthood that’s blinded the minds of the
   people into believing a lie. And God said, "Because they wouldn't, because not of a love of the
   revelation of this hour, the truth, God would give them over to a reprobate mind to believe a lie,
   this Eli Priesthood and be damned. Now that’s meat.
   So, what do we have in this hour? An Eli Priesthood that’s corrupted, Brother. A
   man... A woman called in this man of God and said, "Brother, what am I going to do? My
   husband has been living in adultery with a girl eighteen years old for two years now and I have
   caught him in it, right in the very act of it." And he’s one of the greatest deliverance men on the
   field today. Come on now. And thousands flock out and are resting their hope of the heavenly
   city upon his message, and TURNED DOWN A MESSAGE THAT’S VINDICATED FROM
   
   14
   HEAVEN WITH ANGELS, WITH THUS SAITH THE LORD FOR THIRTY YEARS. NOT
   ONE WORD’S FAILED.
   Oh, Pentecostal people, what’s the matter with you? My God! Thirty years, THUS
   SAITH THE LORD, and not one Word failed. Angels came down from heaven, there are
   pictures of it right back there. "Show it to them;" say, "Well, isn't that something?" Walk right
   on.
   My God, it ought to knock you to your knees, to know that the same sign that was with
   the church, that come out of Egypt and the same one that knocked Paul off his horse going to
   Damascus, is made manifested in this hour, to condemn this Eli Priesthood. And the Pentecostals
   walk right over it, and keep right on shouting. They’ll shout their way right into the tribulation,
   then right on to hell. Brother, I know it is hard, but it is true. It’s God's Word and it’s true.
   I want you to show me a way that is evil spoken of. If this message, that this prophet and
   messenger didn't bring; it dovetails from Genesis to Revelation. And Brother, great men that
   wrote many of the doctrines of the Pentecostal churches had to bow down to it before him and
   confess that their doctrine would not hold up in the scrutiny life of the prophet. I know plenty of
   them, brother, that wrote the doctrine. Some of the people that’s still in their jailhouse, trying to
   get by, can't come out. You talking about a sad situation, brother and sister, it is.
   But as this great thing in this hour comes to climax, we have the two wives of Elkanah
   right now again--Hannah and the wife that persecuted Hannah. Right now, when we have to
   stand and declare this message of this prophet as brought to us by Malachi four. The ministers in
   this message have to stand by faith and look back to the vindication that God vindicated that this
   message was truth.
   We looked back to the angels when we sat there and God spoke to the prophet and said
   that there would be seven angels appear to him, I sat right there. And then a few months later,
   science puts the picture in Life Magazine. They measured the quake, the earthquake that the
   angels caused when they came from eternity. We talked to the fifteen men that was there and
   seen it all. We seen it all come to pass.
   And now while the other Eli Priesthood out here looks and mocks and says, "YOU ARE
   PREACHING A MAN..." BUT WHILE THEY SAY THAT, THEIR OWN SELVES ARE
   FOLLOWING SOME MAN'S CREED, THAT WAS PLANTED IN THEIR CHURCH
   DOCTRINE. THAT ISN'T BACKED UP BY THE POWER OF GOD. HALLELUJAH. Can
   you say, "Amen?" Brother, how can we but talk about a messenger that every word that he
   spoke, came to pass around the world for thirty years. My God, that’s enough to anchor you in
   concrete forty foot deep. And anchor you so strong, brother, as the great anchor that holds the
   American ships that they sail across the seas.
   Now, the great stage is set for one of the greatest manifestations of the power of God that
   has ever been seen in the world, is now at hand. You may not believe it, but it will come to pass
   anyway.
   As this Eli Priesthood goes on in its corruption, Hannah, the Bride, is burdened about the
   whole thing. And her adversary is provoking her sore and said, "Well, if that message is true,
   why isn't God vindicating it through you?" And they’re pricking her with that. They’re pricking
   her with it. Said, "Why we got the gifts in the Spirit over here." Said, "You’ll, you’ll got to
   preaching a man over there." The same thing they did to Hannah.
   
   15
   But you know, there is a time, there is a time and a season for everything. Just as they
   said to Jesus, "Why now, if you will come down off the cross, we’ll believe that message." Is
   that right? But He didn't play for anybody.
   And, as Hannah sees the condition of this Eli Priesthood today, she should be getting
   burdened about it. And when Hannah gets so burdened about it and travailing, and the
   persecution from the World Council of Churches gets so strong, God is going to hear her cry and
   give her a Man-child, Jesus, that Jesus might purge the temple once more with his power and by
   his word. Hallelujah!
   Now I want you to know that the Bible declares that there will be a time when no more
   can you be saved because the Blood will have left the mercy seat. You remember that Paul,
   speaking in the book of Romans, said, "When the iniquity of the Gentiles was fulfilled that God
   would turn from the Gentiles and go to the Jews. My brother and sister, you are living in that
   hour now. They’re by the Weeping Wall in Israel now, weeping for the Messiah and he’s getting
   ready to appear to them.
   Romans 11:25-Reference quote:
   25 For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in
   your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles
   be come in.

   When the fig tree puts forth its buds… The six-point Star of David hanging over there, the oldest
   flag in the world, flying again for the first time for two thousand years, no, twenty-five hundred
   years. Think of it. They said, “Where is the Messiah?” And then when they read these Bibles,
   they said, “If this Jesus was the Messiah, and He claims here that He’s raised from the dead, let
   us see Him do the sign of the prophet. We’ll believe Him.” Oh, what a real thing. My heart
   jumped. I said, “I want a ticket, I’m going. I’ll call thousands of them out.” Say, “Did you mean
   that?” They believe their prophets. And when I got to Cairo, Egypt, thirty minutes of Palestine,
   I’d had my ticket in my hand. They were ready to make the first call. Something struck, said,
   “Not now. The wrath of God has not yet come to the Gentiles. Their iniquity is not yet
   fulfilled.” I thought, surely, that’s my imaginary mind. I started on out again; I thought, “I’ll
   walk out towards the ramp.” And I started walking out, and then there stood that Light, that you
   see on the picture. 49 That’s the same Pillar of Fire that led the children of Israel. That’s the
   same thing that this… If that Light that you see there, which they got here in America, they got It
   in Germany, they got It in Switzerland, where they’ve taken the pictures of it. That Light will
   bear record of what It is. And if that Light isn’t of God, It won’t bear record of God. But if It
   does the same works that Jesus did when He was here on earth, that said, “He come from that
   Light,” that was in the… Moses in the wilderness. “Before Abraham was, I am.” When He was
   here on earth, look what He done in flesh. He said, “But I come from God, and I go back to
   God.” And when He returned after His resurrection, Paul met Him on the road to Damascus,
   and here He was a Pillar of Fire again. Such a Light so close to Paul, It put his eyes out, and he
   had to be led. 50 He would… come into the prison with Peter as a Light. He’s returned back
   that. Here He is again at the end of the Gentile age to do just exactly to the way He did back
   
   16
   there. Any vine bears fruit through the branch of what it is. If it don’t do the same thing Jesus
   did, then it’s not Jesus. Certainly. If I told you the spirit of John Dillinger was in me, I’d have
   guns, and I’d be dangerous. If I told you the spirit of an artist was in me, you’d expect me to
   paint the picture of the artist. If I say, “The Spirit of Christ in me,” then it produces the works of
   Christ. He promised it. 51 And then, when I walked out to the ramp, He said, “It’s not yet; it’s
   for a season yet.” And I turned and went up to Mars Hill, from that back to the Vatican, then
   back home. “Not just the time.” When those Jews receive the gospel, you Gentiles are finished.
   God deals with Jews as a nation, us as a people, the Jews always as a nation, the nation of
   Israel. 52 We’re at the end time. This is a call to the Gentiles. God be merciful. He’s here. You
   have to be with Him, or He can do nothing for you.

   61-0730M - Gabriel's Instructions To Daniel
   William Marrion Branham
   153 And I was on my road, and stood at Cairo, Egypt, with the ticket in my hand, and fifteen or
   twenty minutes of calling time. They was fixing to make the call. And I walked down to see a little
   piece of this ebony, with a little elephant made out of ebony, with a—a ivory tusk. I was going to
   send it to a doctor friend of mine, Dr. Sam Adair, for a paper weight. And I was looking at it.
   And Something said to me, “This is not yet the hour. Stay out of Palestine.” 154 So I thought,
   “That was just me thinking that.” And I went on. Something said, “This is not the hour.” 155
   And I went out behind the hangar. I raised up my head to God. I said, “God, was that You
   speaking to me?” 156 Said, “This is not the hour. Stay out of Palestine. This is not the time.”
   Then I took my ticket and changed it, and went from there up through Rome, and come back to
   Lisbon, in Portuguese, and from there back to the United States. 157 The hour was not yet. The
   iniquity of the Gentiles hasn’t filled up yet, just to the end of the cup. But some day that will be,
   and God will send somebody there that’s a prophet, and will prove to them. I trust that God will
   raise him up right away, whoever he may be, that’ll raise him quickly. I believe it has to come.
   That’s what we’re studying this for, that we’re so close. 158 And, remember, the very minute that
   the Jews receive Christ, the Gentile Church is gone. Then the Gentiles has the plagues poured
   out upon them, the Tribulation.
   So, the last curtain call for this hour that you’re living in is now getting ready to be made
   manifested. The seed of the husband, Christ, has been planted in Hannah and, when Hannah
   begins to travail in birth, she is going to give birth to a Man-child, Jesus Christ, and he’s gonna
   purge this temple, brother. He’s going to fulfill what he didn't fulfill when he sat down in the
   temple in his hometown and when he said, "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me." And He went on
   down, but He didn't quote the rest of the Scripture in Isaiah. He left out, "In the day of the
   vengeance of our God." And that is to be fulfilled in this Man-child, Jesus, made manifested in
   this time.
   Luke 4:16-21-Reference quote:
   16 And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as his custom was, he went
   into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up for to read.

   17 And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Esaias. And when he had opened
   the book, he found the place where it was written,
   18 The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the
   poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and
   recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised,
   19 To preach the acceptable year of the Lord.
   20 And he closed the book, and he gave it again to the minister, and sat down. And the eyes of
   all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him.
   21 And he began to say unto them, This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears.
   Isaiah 61:1-3-Reference quote
   1 The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me; because the Lord hath anointed me to preach good
   tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the
   captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound;
   2 To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of vengeance of our God; to
   comfort all that mourn;
   3 To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for
   mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of
   righteousness, the planting of the Lord, that he might be glorified.
   HE WILL COME FORTH WHEN THE BLOOD IS OFF OF THE MERCY SEAT AS
   THE LION OF THE TRIBE OF JUDAH AND HE’LL PURGE THIS THING, brother. Don't
   think he won't. He’ll purge it, because He has His Word in the Bride and He acts by his own
   spirit, by his word and the word will be a Flaming Fire of vengeance, taking vengeance on them
   that obey not the Gospel of Jesus Christ. The Bible said, "And the wrath of God abideth upon the
   children of disobedience." Can you say, "Amen?"

   56-0408E - The Time Is At Hand
   William Marrion Branham
   There come a time where there had to be the voice of one crying in the wilderness. Isaiah, eight
   hundred and twelve years before, had prophesied that there’d be a voice of one crying in the
   wilderness. How little did the people know it. How little was they expecting it. The ages had went
   on, and they—and the places, the idea of the supernatural, and the idea of those things that faded
   from the people’s hearts. 22 And all of a sudden, right out of the blue sky, as we say it, there
   came a fellow out of the wilderness, a burly looking fellow, a preaching repentance and telling
   the people that the axe was laid to the root of the tree. And every tree that didn’t bring forth
   
   18
   good fruit was hewed down and cast into the fire. And he said, “I indeed baptize you with
   water unto repentance, but there cometh One after me.” If the people would have been aware
   of the prophecy of God, they’d have knowed that John was to prepare the way of the Lord,
   according to the prophecy. He said, “I am not He, but there’s coming One after me, Whose
   shoes I am not worthy to loose. He will baptize with the Holy Ghost and Fire. And His fan is
   in His hand. And He will thoroughly purge His floors and—and gather the wheat into the
   garner and burn the chaff with unquenchable fire.”
   
   I want you to look, just a minute, over in the book of Revelation, when John was
   watching the Seals being opened, when the voice cried out and said, "Who is worthy to open the
   book and loose the seals thereof?" And they looked on earth and they looked in heaven and no
   man was able to come forth to open the Seals thereof. Then how could some man out of some
   seminary open them up then? What a ridiculous... How could some Pentecostal preacher open
   them up? When the Bible said, "No man is worthy to open them up."
   Revelation 5:2-5-Reference quote;
   2 And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and
   to loose the seals thereof?
   3 And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book,
   neither to look thereon.
   4 And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book, neither to
   look thereon.
   5 And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Juda, the Root
   of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof.

   60 Now, after we get through with the Seven Seals, then, at that time of the sounding of the
   Seventh Seal, or the loosening… Course, we know what a seal is, is to LOOSE THE
   MINISTRY, TO LOOSE SEVEN SEALS. And we’ll see that right on the chart. Is loosing a
   Message, something that’s sealed up. 61 Last Sunday night, I preached on, “The Key.” And
   THE KEY IS FAITH. THE FAITH HOLDS THE KEY, AND THE KEY IS THE
   SCRIPTURE. AND CHRIST IS THE DOOR. SEE? SO FAITH TAKES THE LITTLE
   HINGES OF THE SCRIPTURE AND UNLOCKS THE GLORIES AND GOOD OF GOD,
   OUT TO HIS PEOPLE. See? So, it’s, FAITH HOLDS THE KEY THAT UNLOCKS CHRIST
   TO THE PEOPLE; UNLOCKS IT, REVEALS IT. 62 SO, TODAY, WE’RE GOING TO TRY
   TO TAKE THAT SAME KEY, TO UNLOCK THE WAY TO BECOME A VIRTUOUS
   CHRISTIAN IN THE STATURE OF GOD, THAT, AND BE A LIVING TABERNACLE
   FOR THE LIVING GOD TO DWELL IN. 63 Remember, God reveals Himself in three ways.
   First time, He revealed Hisself in a Pillar of Fire, that was called the Fatherhood. Then that
   same God, made manifested in Jesus Christ, which He built a body, made this body. Thirdly,
   through the death of that body, He sanctified a Church that He can dwell in.

   244 All the host of Heaven was silent for this half hour, when this Seventh-Seal mystery in the
   Book of Redemption was broke open. Think of it. But, It’s broke. THE LAMB BREAKS IT.
   You know what? They were awed by It, I believe. They didn’t know; there It was! They just
   stopped.
   Revelation 5:4-Reference quote:
   4 And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book, neither to
   look thereon.
   But when John looked and they began to weep and cry because the Book was the Title
   Deed to the earth and the redemption. And then as they all began to weep and cry because they
   thought that all humanity was lost. And then, there came a voice said, "Weep not, John," said,
   "Behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah...." (Is that right?) And he turned to see a lion, and
   coming out of the office of the mediatorial priest where he made intercession for you when you
   got saved, when the Seals were opened he came out of there. And when He looked to see a lion,
   he saw a bloody Lamb, Jesus. And He came up to the throne of the eternal Father and took the
   Book and sat down as God Almighty, Creator of Heaven and earth.
   Revelation 5:6-7-Reference quote:
   6 And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts, and in the midst of the

   63-0317E - The Breach Between The Seven Church Ages And The Seven Seals
   William Marrion Branham
   220 Others had guessed at, in the denominational age. But, see, he must be this man, the seventh
   angel of…Revelation 10:1-4 is a…The seventh angel has the mysteries of God given to him, and
   finishes all the mysteries that’s been left off, down through the denominational ages. 221 Now
   you can see why I do not strike at my brethren in denomination. It’s the system of denomination!
   They do not, there is no need of them trying to know It, because It could not be revealed. That’s
   according to the Word. They presumed at It, and believed It was there, and by faith walked by It,
   but now It’s evidently proved. Amen. Oh, my, what a—what a Scripture! 222 Now watch. Then it
   is He, the Lamb, that takes His Kingly position, when His saints come to crown Him, “Lord of
   lord, and King of kings.” See? 223 See, “Time has run out.” Revelation 10:6, “There is no
   more time.” 224 Notice, there is “seven horns” on this Lamb. Did you notice it? “Having
   seven horns.” We’ve just been through that. Horns means “power,” to the animal. And,
   notice, He was not a animal, because He took the Book out of the right hand of Him that sat
   
   20
   upon the Throne. See? Notice. Oh, my! 225 I believe I had that wrote down somewhere; oh,
   TO BREAK THE SEALS, AND TO LOOSE THE TITLE, THE TITLE DEED, AND THE—
   THE MESSAGE TO THE LAST ANGEL. And He takes His Kingly place. That’s what He
   comes forth now to do. Now watch, when He comes out, “The seven horns.” 226 NOW, WHEN
   HE SAW THIS LAMB, JOHN LOOKING AT IT, IT—IT LOOKED LIKE HE HAD BEEN
   SLAIN, BLOODY. And He has come from Eternity, and He ceased to be a Mediator. 227 Then
   pray to Mary as much as you want to! “There was no man in Heaven, and in earth, or no person,
   no being nowhere else, could take it.” John even wept about it. Oh, Catholic friend, can’t you
   see that? Don’t pray to some dead person. 228 The Lamb is the only Mediator. See? He was the
   One that came forth. And what did He do now? He’s been back here interceding, until His Blood
   has atoned for every person. And the Lamb, now, knows what’s written in the Book. So, He
   knowed from the foundation of the world their names were in There, so He has stood back
   here and re-…and—and, but, done Mediator work like this until…mediatorial work, till every
   one that’s been put in the Book has been redeemed, and it’s finished. AND NOW HE WALKS
   OUT. SEE? HE DONE HIS KINSMAN WORK. He is all…You know what the Kinsman work
   was? To testify before elders. You remember Boaz kicking off his shoe, and so forth? He has
   done all this now. 229 NOW HE COMES TO TAKE HIS BRIDE. AMEN. HE COMES NOW
   AS KING. HE IS LOOKING FOR HIS QUEEN. Amen. Amen. In this Book IS THE WHOLE
   SECRET OF IT, WRAPPED UP AROUND, SEVEN SEALS. Oh, brother! Seven Seals,
   waiting for Him to come. Notice. 230 Let’s get these symbols. Well, it’s just nine o’clock. We got
   three hours or more, to go. We got…let’s just…Satan keep telling me them people is getting
   tired, so I guess they are. But let—let’s take this, anyhow. 231 “Seven horns” was the seven
   churches, see, the seven church ages, because that was the Lamb’s protection. What He
   protected His rights with, on earth, was a God-sent Group of people that protected; see, the horn
   on the Lamb. 232 “Seven eyes” are the seven messengers of the seven church ages. “Seven
   eyes,” seven seers. 233 Would you like to write down some Scripture? Let’s just turn to it. What
   do you say, you got that much time? [Congregation says, “Amen.”—Ed.] All right. Let’s go to
   Zechariah, the Book of—of Zechariah, just a little bit, and we’ll—we’ll read some of this. 234 I—
   I don’t want to keep you too long on these things. And—and I…But, yet, I don’t want you to miss
   it. What’s any more important than this? [Congregation says, “Amen.”—Ed.] Yeah. What’s
   more…[Someone in the congregation says, “Brother Branham?”] What? [“You don’t measure
   that.”] Nothing more important than Eternal Life to a person. And we must—we must get this
   now, and—and be sure that we get it. All right. All right, sir. 235 And now we want to read
   Zechariah the 3rd chapter. I think that’s right, now, Zechariah 3. We’re just going to get these
   symbols here, if I’ve got my Scriptures wrote down. I was just shouting all over the place, this
   afternoon, when I hit this. So I—I just don’t know whether I got it right, or not. I hope I have.
   Zechariah 3, let’s see if it’s…I got 89 here, but it must be 8 to 9. All right. All right. I know it
   can’t be 89. Zechariah 3:8 and 9. Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, thou, and thy fellows that
   sit with thee: for they are men wondered at: for, BEHOLD, I WILL BRING FORTH MY
   SERVANT THE BRANCH (CHRIST). For behold the stone that I will lay before Joshua; upon
   (stone) one stone shall be seven eyes: (seven eyes), behold, I will engrave the graving thereon,
   saith the Lord of host,…I will remove the iniquity of the land in one day. 236 Now let’s turn over
   to Zechariah 4:10, 4:10. Listen. …who hath despised the day of small things (God in simplicity,
   see)? for they shall rejoice, and…see the plummet in the hands of Zerubbabel with
   whose…with those seven; these are the eyes of the Lord, which run to and fro through the
   whole earth. 237 “The seven eyes.” Eyes mean “seeing.” Seeing means “prophets, seers.” This
   
   21
   Lamb had seven horns, and on each horn had an eye, “seven eyes.” What is it? Christ and His
   Bride; seven church ages. Out of there was seven prophets that went forth, seven seers, eyes. So,
   the last one must be a seer. [Brother Branham knocked on the pulpit two times as he said, “a
   seer.”—Ed.] All right. 238 Notice, He is not an animal. “He took the Book out of the right hand
   of Him that sat upon the Throne.” Who was It? The—the Owner, the original Owner, that had
   the Book of Redemption in His right hand. And no Angel, no Angelic Being, nothing else, could
   take the place. “AND THIS BLOODY LAMB WALKED OUT AND TOOK THE BOOK OUT
   OF HIS HAND.” WHEW! WHAT WAS IT? BROTHER, THIS IS THE MOST SUBLIME
   THING IN THE SCRIPTURE. An act that not an Angel, not nothing, could do it. “And the
   Lamb come and took It from the right hand of Him that sat upon the Throne.” 239 What is it?
   NOW IT BELONGS TO THE LAMB. Amen. GOD’S LAWS REQUIRED. HE’S THE ONE
   THAT HOLDS IT. GOD’S LAW REQUIRED A KINSMAN REDEEMER. AND THE LAMB
   COME OUT, HOLDING IT, “I AM THEIR KINSMAN. I AM THEIR REDEEMER. I
   NOW…I HAVE MADE INTERCESSION FOR THEM, AND NOW I’VE COME TO CLAIM
   THEIR RIGHTS FOR THEM.” AMEN. THERE’S THE ONLY ONE. “I’VE COME TO
   CLAIM THEIR RIGHTS. IN THAT, THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO EVERYTHING THAT
   LOST IN THE FALL, AND I’VE PAID THE PRICE.” 240 Oh, brother! Whew! Don’t that
   make you feel religious inside? [Congregation says, “Amen.”—Ed.] “NOT BY GOOD WORKS
   WHICH WE HAVE DONE, BUT BY HIS MERCY.”
   And the place where He made intercession for you and I... John looked and it was now
   smoking. What was the smoke? It was the smoke. What was the lightning? What was the
   thunder? THE JUDGMENTS OF GOD GETTING READY TO BE POURED OUT UPON
   THIS CHURCH WORLD THAT’S REJECTED THE MESSAGE THAT IS VINDICATED BY
   GOD.
   If you don't believe it, then what do you think of California is getting ready to sink
   for? If you don't believe it, why do you think that Florida, any day, may sink to the bottom of the
   ocean. Say, "I don't believe it." It is going to happen, it may happen tonight. We have no
   assurance from God at all. You say, "I know that God is going to speak to me." You don't know.

   William Marrion Branham
   7 We find ourselves, at this Christmas, just about like they did the first Christmas though. The
   world’s just about to fall apart. As I preached on once, somewhere, about a Christmas message,
   The World Falling Apart. And the world again is just about to come to pieces. Look at the
   earthquakes over here in California. I predict, before the coming of the Lord Jesus, that God
   will sink that place. I believe that Hollywood and Los Angeles, and them filthy places over
   there, that God Almighty will sink them. They’ll go beneath the bottom of the sea. And it’s so
   much sin, you see, it’s the barrier. 48 Civilization has traveled with the sun, from…and it started
   in the East, going west. And now it’s at the West Coast. If it goes any further, it’ll be back East
   again. So that’s the barrier. And sin has traveled with civilization, and it becomes the cesspool of
   all ages. Things they do that—that human beings in any other age wouldn’t have thought of such
   
   22
   a thing. Woman has throwed theirself to such a filth, till no woman in any age would’ve ever
   thought of such a thing as we do today. And then still call ourselves Christians. What a disgrace!
   49 No wonder the great prophet raised up, and he said, “I’m not a prophet nor the son of a
   prophet, but…” Said: The lion has roared, and who cannot fear? And…God has spoke, and
   who can keep from prophesy? See? There’s something that’s got to call out. 50 We’re in a
   critical hour; the world is. But the Church, the real Church (not the denomination); BUT THE
   CHURCH, ITSELF, IS READY FOR THE GREATEST TRIUMPH IT EVER MADE: THE
   COMING OF THE GROOM TO THE BRIDE. 51 WE ARE COMING APART, LOOKING
   FOR A MESSIAH (SOMETHING) TO COME AND SAVE US, GET US OUT OF ALL OF
   IT.
   The Bible said, "Those that walk after the flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption."
   Galatians 6:8-9-Reference quote:
   8 For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the
   Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.
   9 And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.
   And the Bride in this hour is walking in the flesh and the carnality of Satan. I know it’s
   hard, but it’s the truth anyway.
   Brother, when you try to measure your life, like the Bible said, "They that live after the
   flesh shall die but if you by the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, you shall live."
   Romans 8:13-Reference quote:
   13 For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of
   the body, ye shall live.
   And the only time that you can lay holt on the promises of God is when you are living
   and abiding in the word of God. Is that right, brothers?
   The Bible said, "They that walk after the Spirit..."Now if you’re walking after the spirit,
   it means that you are walking into perfection like the Statue of the Perfect Man--Faith, Virtue,
   Knowledge, Temperance, Patience, Brotherly Kindness and Godliness and Love. Now that is the
   spirit walk of the believer.
   I believe that God surely would speak to me if Florida would sink tonight, but I don't
   have no proof that he would. Unless my life comes up to the word of God...
   They asked this great messenger, said, "Well Brother, you pinned it down so close, is
   there anybody gonna to make the rapture? Are you going to make it?" He said, "I don't
   know." He said, "If my life comes up to the word of God, I will make it and if not, I won't." You
   remember this, brother; if you were pulling, a semi-truck down the road with a bus, tonight, with
   a great heavy chain but one little link in there had a little flaw in it... And when it broke, you lost
   your hope.
   And when you as a Christian fail to obey the word of God you’re like a person hanging
   over hell with a chain and, when one link breaks, you drop. That is why that the Saints of God...

   102 Now to go back in Genesis, which is the beginning. Genesis means “the beginning.” We find
   that God gave His family Eternal Life as long as they stayed in this Word and lived by this
   Word. But when they broke it, just one link in the chain of promises, death struck them, which
   was a promise also. 103 It’s a chain. You’re hanging over hell with it, and that’s the only
   thing that’ll carry you through. When the believer becomes a make-believer and lives on one
   word that’s contrary to this Word, he cuts his fellowship with God. One link broke! And,
   remember, your faith in this Word is like a chain. A chain is its strongest at its weakest link.
   That’s right. It’s the strongest, that, ’cause that’s all it’ll hold. And if there is something in the
   Word that’s puzzling to you, something that you have heard different, but they said, “Thee? Oh,
   that was for the apostles, and them things was for days gone by,” when the Scripture said Jesus
   Christ is the same yesterday, today and forever, don’t let that be a weakness! Fortify It and hold
   It, and wrap your life into It, because that’s the only thing that’ll take you over the flames of hell.
   That’s right. 104 When this chain is broke, with Adam and Eve, the first family, now remember,
   they didn’t break a sentence, they didn’t break three Words; one Word! Man shall hang over hell
   by every Word, every Word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God. That’s where man’s Eternal
   destination is determined. Why, he’ll hang by that chain, or he’ll hang by a creed; or if there is
   creed mixed into the chain, there is where the weak link is, and you’re gone. That’s where the
   weak link was with Adam and with Eve. That weak link, “surely,” he said, “God…” But surely
   God said it! And if God said it, God meant it. And He also keeps His Word by saying, “The day
   you eat thereof, that day you die.” The day you put into you anything else besides the
   unadulterated Word of God, into your soul, that’s the day that you’re separated from God. 105
   Now this is very strong, but just listen close. Now notice. One Word, one Word of the first of
   the Bible, God said that, “One Word, separated man from its Eternal Life Chain.” 106 That’s
   like taking a man and you hang him, by his feet…he’s got his hands in Heaven, and you cut
   him half in two, break off a toe, whatever you’re hanging unto. You’re hanging on the very
   bottom part, and, you break that chain, anywhere, you’re gone. Now bear that in mind.
   
   The Bible said, "Work out your salvation WITH FEAR AND TREMBLING."
   Philippians 2:12-Reference quote:
   12 Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much
   more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.
   Can you show me one person that’s filled with such fear that they’re trembling all over that they
   won't make the rapture? You say, "I got the Holy Ghost." I’ll give you a witness and you’ll see
   whether you got it or not.

   58 The promise of Abraham was that his “Seed,” now his royal Seed, also, as I told you a while
   ago. And this seal that He give Abraham, was a seal of promise. And the royal Seed, according
   to Ephesians 4:30, is “sealed by the Holy Ghost,” after they have stood the test. Try to think of
   it. 59 MANY THINK THEY GOT THE HOLY GHOST. MANY CLAIM TO HAVE THE
   HOLY GHOST. Many can show many evidences and signs of it. But, still, if it can’t stay with
   this Word, it’s not the Holy Ghost. See? 60 You believe every Word, then you are sealed after
   the test. When we believe every promise in the Word, then we are sealed by the Spirit, to
   confirm the promise. That’s what, it’s what Abraham, the way he did it. Then, and then only,
   have we the right to possess the gate of our enemy. You cannot do it until first you become that
   Seed. Remember, in the Bible…

   62 The choice of your conduct. You could…You can’t mix it now. You’re either for God or
   against God, and the outward expressions shows exactly what’s on the inside. See? The
   cocklebur…MANY OF YOU THINK, “I GOT THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST, I’M
   GOING TO HEAVEN.” That don’t mean one thing that you’re going to Heaven. No, sir. You
   can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost every hour in your life, and still be lost and go to hell.
   The Bible says so. Uh-huh, that’s exactly right.

   60-0313 - Hear Ye Him
   William Marrion Branham
   37 Now, you see, Jesus had proven to God that He’d been the right kind of Son. And God took
   Him up on the top of the mountain, brought witnesses out there—heavenly witnesses and earthly
   witnesses—and He clothed Him in immortality. When they looked up, they said, “His garments
   shined like the sun.” A supernatural something taken place. His garments glistened like the sun
   in its middle of the day, as white as they could be. God placed on Him that robe of immortality,
   showing that He had received Him. That’s the thing that God will do to His sons here on earth
   someday. He will call you aside, Church, if you’ll only obey Him and stay on the Word and
   believe it. And He will place into the Church, before the coming of Jesus Christ… He will
   place into the Church… All the powers that Christ had in Him will be in the Church. All that
   God was, He poured into Jesus; all that Jesus was, He pours into the Church. God wanting
   His work done, He sent it into His Son; the Son wanting the work done, sent it into the
   Church. “At that day you’ll know that I’m in the Father, the Father in Me, and I in you, and
   you in Me.” At that day, because the same power of God, was in Jehovah God, rested in Jesus
   Christ. The same power that rested in Jesus Christ, rests in the placed sons in the body of
   Christ. 38 Placing of a son… Take him out in a certain place, have a ceremony before Angels,
   and place him positionally what he is in the body of Christ. Then that person has the
   
   25
   authority. Let me say this, if you count me a fanatic from this night on. That very same thing that
   I’m speaking of will be done. THERE’LL BE A POWER PUT INTO THE CHURCH, AND
   NOW IS COMING IN, THAT THE HOLY SPIRIT WILL SO ANOINT THE PEOPLE, TILL
   THEY’LL SPEAK THE WORD AND IT’LL CREATE ITSELF RIGHT THERE. WE
   HAVEN’T SEEN POWERS LIKE’S COMING INTO THE CHURCH NOW. I know it for a
   fact. “Say unto this mountain be moved. Don’t doubt in your heart, but believe that what
   you’ve said shall come to pass, you can have what you have said”: THE PLACING OF THE
   CHURCH IN POSITION, WHERE THE FULNESS OF THE POWER OF THE HOLY
   GHOST COMES INTO THE CHURCH. THEN CRITICS’ MOUTHS WILL BE SHUT.
   IT’LL BE A SHORT TIME. Jesus come right off the mountain, went straight to Calvary.
   NOTICE, IT WON’T LAST LONG, BUT IT’LL BE HERE.

   09 Now watch this now. We’re coming to making the hundredth millionth’s of a hair, right
   down to the sharp edge of the Gospel, “Sharper than a two-edged sword, cutting even to the
   asunder of the bone, and a Discerner!” Hallelujah! God, let it go through. “A Discerner of the
   thoughts of the mind.” That’s the Gospel, the Power of God. The Word of God made manifest
   is the Gospel. You say, “The Bible said. That’s—that’s the Word of God.” 110 Well, the Word
   made manifest is the Gospel. THE GOSPEL CAME TO US NOT THROUGH WORD ONLY,
   BUT THROUGH POWER AND DEMONSTRATIONS OF THE HOLY GHOST, TO
   DEMONSTRATE THE POWER, MAKE THE GOSPEL LIVE.
   
   The Bible said in Ezekiel, "Mark all those that are weeping and wailing between the
   porch and the altar for the abominations that’s done in the city. These are they that are sealed by
   God." Can you take us or myself to any church where the believers are filled with the Holy
   Ghost, are weeping and wailing as Hannah was between the porch and the altar for the
   abominations that’s done in the churches and the priesthood and in the city?
   Ezekiel 9:4-Reference quote:
   4 And the Lord said unto him, Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem,
   and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations
   that be done in the midst thereof.

   61 Sister, brother, do you know the Bible said just for the Holy Ghost to mark those who sigh
   and cry for the abominations did in the city? NOW, I WANT TO ASK YOU A QUESTION.
   WE MAKE SO MUCH EMOTION OVER OUR RELIGIOUS IDEAS, BUT WHO IS IT IN
   THE CITY, TONIGHT, IN JEFFERSONVILLE, THAT’S SO CONCERNED ABOUT THE
   
   26
   LOST WORLD, IN THIS LAST DAY, THAT EVEN SPEND THIRTY MINUTES, A NIGHT,
   PRAYING FOR THE SINS OF THE CITY? But according to the Scripture, the Angel of God
   was only to seal those who sighed and cried for the abomination. 62 WE’RE NOT
   INTERESTED NO MORE. We just want to know that we can have a good time. We want to
   know that we can have a little society in our church. We want to know that we’ve got a—a vote
   coming, when it comes time to elect the next pastor. We want our church to look a little better
   than the next fellow’s church. That’s the idea of this world today. No one begging, “O Lord God,
   come to me quickly, or I’ll perish. Oh, pass me not, O Saviour. You was omnipotent. You Who
   are omnipresent, come and dwell in my heart, O Lord.” It’s even hard to get a man or woman to
   raise their hand, to accept the Lord Jesus as Saviour. THE OLD-FASHION MOURNERS’
   BENCH HAS BEEN TAKEN OUT. THERE IS NO MORE WEEPING. THERE IS NO
   MORE CRYING AT THE ALTAR.

   I said, “Of course not. It wasn’t sent for unbelievers. It was only sent to those who believe. It’s
   believers that receive it, not unbelievers. It wasn’t meant for them. It was sent to condemn them.
   Remember, the same waters that drowned the world, saved Noah.” Right. And the same Holy
   Spirit, and the same old fashion Gospel that will take the church home someday in the rapture,
   will condemn and bring judgment to the unbeliever. That’s exactly right. There we stand. God in
   His mercy… 31 Now, what if the picture changes. And the son is a correct son. How he likes to
   be about the father’s business. How he loves to do the things that the father likes for him to
   do. Oh, how the Ho—the tutor would come to the father and say, “Sir, oh, I bring you great
   news. Your boy, he’s… (Excuse the expression in my typing), but he’s just a chip off the old
   block. (We would say.) He’s just like his daddy.” Well, that’s the way the Holy Spirit wants to
   bring it when you believe all of God’s Word, when you accept the whole full Gospel, when you
   believe in everything God wrote it’s the truth. God wants you to believe it that way. Then how
   the father must swell his chest out, say, “Yes, that’s my boy.” And what happened then? Later
   on, there come a time when that father adopted that child into the family. Or to you clergymen
   there, the placing of a son is what I’m speaking of. HE ADOPTED HIS OWN CHILD OR
   PLACED HIM POSITIONALLY IN HIS FAMILY. Now, he was just a boy to begin with. He—
   he… They had to find out what his character was. That’s what God has been trying to do when
   He rained the Holy Ghost down on you all about forty years ago, when you had the old days,
   when you had prayer meetings all night long, when you wept, and cried, and prayed, and
   agonized for sinners. And today you have to beg them to come to the altar to pray with a
   penitent sinner. What happened? 32 THE HOLY GHOST SAID HE ONLY SEAL THOSE
   WHO WEPT AND SIGHED FOR THE ABOMINATION THAT WAS DID IN THE CITY.
   WHO WOULD HE SEAL IN THIS CITY TONIGHT? WHO LAYS ON THEIR FACE DAY
   AND NIGHT CRYING FOR THE SINS IN THE CITY? CAN YOU PUT YOUR FINGER ON
   ONE? See, the storm’s about over. And that is right. But here we are. Now, if he was an obedient
   child, he loved his father, no matter what any of the other boys said on the next farm, he knew
   what his father wanted. He could tell from the way he’d built and what he had did, that what
   he—what he wanted. And a man that’s a son of God reads the Bible and see what God was
   yesterday, He’s the same today. He believes Him to be the same in principle, in power,
   
   27
   everything that He ever was, the great Jehovah is still the same. The Bible said. Hebrews 13:8.
   “Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever.” THAT’S A TRUE SON BELIEVES
   THAT. 33 THEN WHEN HE PROVED TO BE A TRUE SON, HERE’S WHAT THE
   FATHER DID: HE TOOK HIM OUT INTO A PUBLIC PLACE IN THE STREET. AND
   THEN HE TOOK THIS SON, AND SET HIM UP, AND HE CLOTHED HIM WITH A
   ROBE, A SPECIAL ROBE FOR THIS SPECIAL OCCASION. AND THEN THERE WAS A
   CEREMONY READ. AND THIS FATHER ADOPTED HIS OWN SON INTO HIS FAMILY.
   AND THEN ANYTHING THAT THAT SON DID WAS ANSWERED BY THE FATHER.
   THE SON’S NAME WAS JUST AS GOOD ON THE CHECK AS HIS FATHER’S WAS,
   BECAUSE HE WAS POSITIONALLY PLACED IN THAT FAMILY.

   59-0628M - A Deceived Church, By The World
   William Marrion Branham
   76 “Samson, the Philistines is on thee.” Branham Tabernacle, worldly-ism is creeping in
   among you. What about it? Have you exposed your secret? Have you exposed that secret that
   God give you when you were wallowing there in the sawdust a few years ago? Have you let it
   creep out with social, formal worship? What’s happened to you? God can come down and
   perform a miracle and go right down through the audience and tell people the secrets of their
   hearts, and everything, and heal the sick and afflicted, and do signs and wonders, and preach
   His Word as hard as they can, by the Holy Ghost; and people say, “Well, I guess that’s all right.
   We enjoy listening to it once in a while, if we’re not too tired.” That’s Branham Tabernacle.
   The Philistines is on thee. 77 When, used to be when the preaching of the Word, and the old
   saints with the tears in their eyes, would rise to their feet and walk, sobbing, maybe not saying
   a word, just walking around, two or three times, and set down, so filled with the Holy Ghost!
   The Word fed them! “Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every Word that proceedeth
   out of the mouth of God.” Philistines is on thee, Branham Tabernacle. Philistines is on you,
   Pentecostal. 78 Course, the Philistines got you, rest of you, long time ago when you organized
   yourself so tight, nothing could come in ’less you was a Presbyterian, Baptist, Methodist,
   Catholic, or something. You wouldn’t have nothing to do with the rest of them. 79 So, revival in
   our day? How can we have it when the regular revival-giver is bound by the world? God won’t
   come in where the world is, you can just depend on that. You associate with the world, then
   it’s—it’s all of it. When you let the world creep in, you go to acting like the world, then you are
   finished. But when you’ll cut loose every fetter from the world, and come to God, God will use
   you until you go to flirting again. 80 Here’s the only hope that I have this morning, to wind up
   my Message, is this, “While Samson was bound, a new shock of hair growed out.” 81 GOD
   SEND US ANOTHER CHURCH JUST BEFORE THE END TIME, THAT THE POWER
   OF THE HOLY GHOST CAN COME INTO HER, IN THE DEMONSTRATIONS OF THE
   SPIRIT, AND MARK 16 CAN FOLLOW THE CHURCH, ACTS 2:4, ACTS 2:38, ALL OF IT
   WILL BE FOLLOWING RIGHT ALONG WITH THE CHURCH. SIGNS AND WONDERS
   ACCOMPANY THE APOSTLES. GREAT SIGNS OF HIS RESURRECTION ACCOMPANY
   THEM. WHILE WE’RE IN PRISON, SURELY GOD’S GROWING A CROP
   SOMEWHERE, FOR THE LAST GREAT KILL. May it be you, my Christian friend here this
   morning, may it be your strength has begin to grow. I pray that this Message this morning, and
   out into the land to where this will go, I trust that this Message will help bring the vitamin to
   
   28
   your system that’ll grow a spiritual Power back into your life again.
   Oh, Friend, if you want to just look down at it, that’s why I said the other night, "Outside
   of predestination, I don't see any Bride whatsoever." How many say, "Amen." Can you compare
   your life to the life of those men in the book of Acts that loved not their lives unto death? And
   everything that they owned they didn't even count that they owned it but parted to everyone as
   they had need. Now it’s my car, my bank account, my food, my house, my this and my that, but
   they had such love that what they had they took it out and gave it to the poor and they took up
   their cross and they followed Jesus daily.

   79 And I believe we’re on the border land tonight. I was wondering about all my meetings and
   things, how I had to cancel them out. I truly believe, before the Church can have the Rapture, it’s
   got to have rapturing faith. WE CAN’T EVEN HAVE FAITH FOR DIVINE HEALING, LET
   ALONE RAPTURING FAITH. Got to have a faith that’ll change and quicken this body, and
   be taken away. I BELIEVE THERE’S A CHURCH ON ITS ROAD TONIGHT, A POWER
   OF THE LIVING GOD, THAT MEN WILL SPEAK THE WORD HERE AND THERE, AND
   IT’LL FLASH LIKE LIGHTNING. And a Church is coming out; not a psychologist, NOT
   SOME OF THIS PUT-ON, MAKE-BELIEF; BUT A REAL, TRUE, GENUINE,
   ANOINTED, HOLY GHOST, CALLED-OUT CHURCH! Amen.
   And when the great God Almighty appeared to Paul, and the man said... Ananias said,
   "Lord, don't you know how great persecutions he has brought upon Thy church, which is at
   Jerusalem, and I hear how he has a letter that he is going down to haul all of you believers into
   prison, both women, boys and girls." He said, "Go your way Ananias, he is a chosen vessel, and I
   will show him how much he shall suffer for me."
   Acts 9:15-16-Reference quote:
   15 But the Lord said unto him, Go thy way: for he is a chosen vessel unto me, to bear my name
   before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel:
   16 For I will shew him how great things he must suffer for my name's sake.
   And the Bible said, "Those that are led by the Spirit and are spiritual minded people, if
   you suffer with me you shall reign with me." Are you suffering for the Cross of Christ? I just
   want to show you if you think you are so spiritual, you’re carnal minded in this hour. "I’ll show
   you how you’ll suffer for me"
   2 Timothy 2:12-Reference quote:
   12 If we suffer, we shall also reign with him: if we deny him, he also will deny us:

   He told Paul… PAUL, THAT GREAT PROPHET OF GOD, SAID, "WE ALWAYS
   BEAR ABOUT IN OUR BODY THE DYING OF THE LORD, JESUS, THAT THE LIFE OF
   JESUS MIGHT BE MADE MANIFESTED IN ME, THE WORD MADE FLESH.
   2 Corinthians 4:10-Reference quote:
   10 Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus
   might be made manifest in our body.
   Herein was the son of God made manifested that he might destroy the works of the
   devil. And brother, if you’re not destroying the works of the devil, then you and I don't know
   whether or not we are seed of…the Royal seed of Abraham. You’ve got to say "Amen" to
   this. It’s the truth!
   You say, you’ve planted a garden out here and you say, "Brother Wells, I want you to
   look at my garden." Brother Wells might say, "I don't see nothing but dirt. I see little furrows
   there, that says 'I am a Christian,'" Amen? said, "I don't see no corn, I don't see no wheat. I don't
   see no potatoes. I can't go out there and get no potatoes. I can't get no corn."
   The Bible said, "Out of your belly shall flow rivers of living water." You know what that
   living water is? Gifts of the Spirit and divine healing and mercy and tenderness and kindness and
   love. Where is it at? But yet we are so bold to say, "I am spiritual, I’m led by the Spirit, I hear
   from God."

   them algebra when they don’t even know their ABCs? THEY DON’T HAVE COMMON
   DECENCY ENOUGH TO CLEAN THEMSELVES UP AND ACT LIKE CHRISTIANS. How
   you going to tell them spiritual things about Heavenly things?” That’s right. 329 Let the
   Pentecostal church straighten itself up, get right with God, and I’ll prove to you that the Holy
   Ghost will come right in. Why, this, the church, will be so full of the power of the Holy Ghost,
   there can’t be one member do one sin. The Holy Ghost will call it right out, like Ananias and
   Sapphira. Right. But you can’t do it, when you won’t even take your kindergarten training.
   Certainly not. 330 Come on up, the altar, like these women have. Say, you mean there’s only two

   Now, do you know the devil believes too? Sure, he does. I explained to you the other night,
   you—like trying to immerse this old turtle. It didn’t do anything to him; it didn’t help him any. It
   took fire to make him move. And so, that’s what it takes for the church today: is a little Holy
   Ghost and fire to make it move. But remo—remember, the Holy Spirit will not take that unclean
   person into His—the body of Christ. That shows that the body of Christ is not a denomination.
   For it’s a mystical body of Christ. And by one Spirit we’re all baptized into it. I think we take
   women, men, and take them to the waters to baptize them. And we find out if they’re really not
   Christians in their heart, we should never baptize them. I was going some time ago with a
   woman to the river, group of them. One woman walked out there; she got out of her car and
   come across, fixing her hair up, she said, “Going to take me down and dunk me, Brother
   Branham?” I said, “Not you, you’re not fit to go in.” That’s right. They was going to have a
   singing at the church, and some girl, she—she didn’t have enough money to—to—to get her
   some kind of a hairdo like that she wanted to do to get up on the platform to sing. And her poor
   old mother washed over a washboard to get that hairdo for her. When I found it out, I wouldn’t
   let her sing. I said, “You’re not fit to sing up there.” That should be kept clean. THAT’S
   WHAT’S THE MATTER TODAY WITH THE CHURCHES, THE CORRUPTION AND
   STUFF, RIGHT FROM THE PULPIT PLUMB TO THE BASEMENT. THAT’S RIGHT.
   CLEAN IT OUT. THAT’S RIGHT. WE NEED THE OLD FASHION SCOURING PAD
   AGAIN IN THE CHURCH. 41 Like the little darkie was being ordained one day, and the elders
   standing around said, “Lord, wrap him up in burlap sacks and pour kerosene on him and set him
   afire for the Gospel.” That’s what we need today: on fire. Turn him loose then and let him run.
   Used to brand calves. We’d take a calf, I know what you’ve roped and hogtied a many one, I
   guess. We used to brand them down. Someone said to me, “Aren’t you ashamed to pack that hot
   iron and stick it on his side?” “No.” I stuck it on his side. He had a kicking fit, all right. He
   squalled and bellowed; when he turned him loose he had a spasm, he really run. But we knowed
   who he belonged to from then on (That’s right.), as long as he lives. And I tell you, brother; it
   takes a lot of grace to come up to the altar and stay there till the Holy Ghost burns a seal down
   in you. You may scream, and cry, and act funny, but you know where you belong from then on.
   That’s right. For you’re sealed in the Kingdom of God by the Holy Spirit. It is the seal. 42
   Remember, the Holy Spirit come to seal those who God foreknew. That’s right. That’s right. He
   just didn’t come down, Jesus, and say, “I’ll die; maybe somebody will have pity and look at Me
   and say, ‘Well, I suppose.’ Maybe if they’ll think I suffered so much it’ll break their hearts and
   they’ll come.” No, no. You won’t come anyhow. You can’t tell a pig he’s wrong by eating on a
   manure pile. He just tell you right quick, if he could talk, “I tend to my business; you tend to
   yours.” See? It takes a conversion. God has to do it. No man comes to Jesus except God draws
   him first. It takes the work of the Holy Spirit to even turn your heart. Takes God. Someone said,
   “I sought God and sought God.” NO, NO, NO. GOD SOUGHT YOU, NOT YOU SEEKING
   GOD. GOD SEEKS YOU. 43 All right, the Holy Spirit doesn’t take in just any kind of a wife,
   doesn’t take in somebody that smokes, and somebody that drinks, and somebody that lives
   immoral, and somebody that carries along with all kinds of worldly things, ’cause He said, “If
   you love the world, the things of the world, the love of God is not even in you.” BUT THE
   HOLY SPIRIT COME TO SEAL INTO THE BODY THE WIFE OF JESUS CHRIST, THAT
   
   31
   HE FOREKNEW BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. WHEN HE… BY
   BEING GOD IN FOREKNOWLEDGE, HE COULD SEE WHO WOULD RECEIVE HIM
   AND WHO WOULD NOT. SO THE HOLY SPIRIT COME TO GET THAT BRIDE. THAT’S
   THE ONE HE TAKES IN. But the church says, “Oh…”
   You know sometimes I think that not many hear from God. I want to tell you something,
   God said to Abraham, Listen now. God said to Abraham after he spoke to him, He said,
   "Abraham walk before me and be thou perfect." Abraham didn't even have the Baptism. Come
   on now. He said to Abraham, TO BE PERFECT!
   Genesis 17:1-Reference quote:
   1 And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the Lord appeared to Abram, and said unto
   him, I am the Almighty God; walk before me, and be thou perfect.
   Brother, what kind of a walk is God expecting out of us in this hour, when He has given
   the blessed Holy Ghost that produces the Agapao love and the Statue of the Perfect
   Man? Brother, I just want to show you something, how short you come to the Glory of God and
   to what is called "Christian."
   The Bible... Listen to this Scripture now, it just came to me. "They that say they abide in
   him ought also to walk even as he walked."
   1 John 2:5-17-Reference quote:
   5 But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that
   we are in him.
   6 He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked.
   7 Brethren, I write no new commandment unto you, but an old commandment which ye had from
   the beginning. The old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning.
   8 Again, a new commandment I write unto you, which thing is true in him and in you: because
   the darkness is past, and the true light now shineth.
   9 He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkness even until now.
   10 He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is none occasion of stumbling in
   him.
   11 But he that hateth his brother is in darkness, and walketh in darkness, and knoweth not
   whither he goeth, because that darkness hath blinded his eyes.
   12 I write unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake.
   13 I write unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning. I write unto
   you, young men, because ye have overcome the wicked one. I write unto you, little children,
   because ye have known the Father.
   14 I have written unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning. I
   have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you,
   and ye have overcome the wicked one.
   15 Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the
   love of the Father is not in him.
   
   32
   16 For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life,
   is not of the Father, but is of the world.
   17 And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth
   for ever.
   And I want you to just hear that record that your tongue is making and recording in

   THEY DON’T PRAY ENOUGH. THEY DON’T CALL UPON GOD ENOUGH. 266 THEY
   JUST LIGHTLY TAKE IT, “Oh, well, I believe there’s a God. Sure!” The devil believes the
   same thing. The devil believes it more than some people claim to believe. The devil believes it
   and trembles. People just believe it and go on. But the devil trembles, knowing his Judgment is
   coming, and people believe it and don’t pay no attention the Judgment is coming. 267 Guilty of
   crucifying Him! Sure! I indict this generation, finding them guilty, by the same Word that
   found them guilty at the beginning. That’s right. Jesus said, “Who can condemn Me?” HE
   WAS THE WORD MADE FLESH. AND TODAY THE SAME WORD IS MADE FLESH.
   The Bible said, be as meek as a lamb and harmless as a dove. Then how could you kill a
   man? How could you kill somebody when the Bible said, "Be ye as meek as a lamb and harmless
   as a dove?" You say, "You preaching to me?" If that fits you, I am preaching right at you,
   pardner. That’s right. I wouldn't dare hold back from God when I see you say something from
   your mouth that... You remember this, by every word are you justified, justified and by every
   word shall God condemn you by your own mouth.

   And this morning I—I might have to apologize to these—some of these fine people here about
   some of those rude remarks about mules being illegitimate. But I—I didn’t mean to be rude or
   sacrilegious, but I was just trying to make a point. You understand, don’t you? 24 Anything a
   mule… Oh, my. That’s what man did. See? He can’t—he can’t come back. He—he can’t go no
   farther. He—He don’t know who his papa, mama is, he’s just—he’s just—he’s just without hope;
   that’s all—that’s all. He—he can never reproduce himself again, so he’s just… But you know, if
   anything he doesn’t have no… He will wait all of his lifetime to get to kick you just before he
   dies, and kill you, if he can. He will sure do it. He—he will just wait all of his lifetime, laying
   
   33
   back just waiting, “Now, I’ll get you around behind me someday.” AND THAT’S JUST THE
   WAY A LOT OF PEOPLE IN CHURCH IS LIKE THAT. THAT’S RIGHT. “OH, I’LL PAT
   YOU ON THE BACK TILL I GET A CHANCE TO CUT YOUR THROAT.” SEE?

   56-0610 - Perfection
   William Marrion Branham
   123 “He that heareth My Words, and believeth on Him that sent Me, hath everlasting Life, the
   Holy Spirit. Shall not come into condemnation, but has passed from death to Life.” 124 When
   the worshipper puts his hands on the head of the dying Lamb of Calvary, and confesses his
   sins, and God recognizes that to be truthful from his heart. He confesses his sin. That circling
   Life, called the Holy Ghost of Jesus Christ, turns back into the worshipper. And he is purged,
   and has no more desire of sin. FOR HE IS LED BY THE SPIRIT OF GOD, AND NOT HIS
   OWN LIFE, FROM THEN ON. HE’LL MAKE MISTAKES, CERTAINLY, BUT THAT
   LIFE WILL HOLD HIM. 125 Watch. Let’s go down to the four-…14th verse. We ain’t got time
   to finish it. Let’s take the 12th verse. But this man, (not the lamb)…Christ! But this man… 126
   He’s talking now of the high priest order. How the priest went into the temple, and so forth;
   worship. How the worshipper went back out with the same desire. A man come to the altar and
   say, “Yes, I don’t want to go to hell.” Preacher preaching on how hot hell is, and the altar is full
   of people. “O God, don’t want to go to hell.” But they’re never willing to yield that self, say,
   “Yes, Lord. Not my will, from this on, but Yours.” 127 Really realize what you’re doing. Say,
   “God, be merciful to me.” The Blood of Jesus is on your hands then. Don’t you go out and start
   living the same life that you did. THAT BLOOD WILL CONDEMN YOU AT THE END, IN
   THE JUDGMENT. YOU BETTER HAVE THE LIFE THAT’S IN THAT BLOOD, TO
   RETURN TO YOUR LIFE’S BLOOD, RETURN TO YOUR HEART AND MAKE YOU LIVE
   A DIFFERENT CHRIS-…A DIFFERENT PERSON. “The worshipper once purged.” Watch
   here. But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sin for (how long?) EVER, (that
   chainless ETERNITY) …for ever, sat down at the right hand of God; (At the end of the road.)
   
   The Bible says, "Be as meek as a lamb and harmless as a dove and that is rapture
   material." And any spirit that is contrary to "...as meek as a lamb and harmless as a dove," is
   tribulation material, and second resurrection. Who is going to be...? "I will be like, I will be like
   the apostles..." Who shall be saved. I mean it Brother and Sister. Who just will be saved, if the
   ungodly... If the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly appear.

   The Lutheran thought they had it when the just shall live by faith. The Methodists said when they
   shouted they had it. They found out they didn’t. The Pentecostals said when they spoke with
   tongues, they had it. THEY FOUND OUT THEY DIDN’T. BROTHER, DON’T TAKE A
   SUBSTITUTE. These things, shouting and speaking in tongues, that’s all right. But that’s an
   attribute. HAVE YOU GOT CHRIST? THAT’S IT. GOT CHRIST IN YOUR HEART,
   BROTHER, SOMETHING THAT MAKES YOU BEAR THE FRUITS OF CHRIST: LOVE,
   JOY, PEACE, LONGSUFFERING, GENTLENESS, GOODNESS, MEEKNESS. 37 Oh, I’ve
   seen people shout, and dance in the Spirit, and speak with tongues, and enough temper to
   fight a buzz saw, and go out, and live e—every day ungodly, and half dress themselves, and—
   and do shady deals, and everything like that. Brother, that’s not the fruits of the Spirit. Come
   on back to the Bible. Come back to the fountain. Come back and receive Christ. These other
   little things will take care of theirself. As long as you receive Christ and the life is going with
   it, these other things will flow freely. BUT DON’T TRY TO GET THE OTHER THING
   BEFORE YOU GET CHRIST. He is the Fountain of Life, the only resource. And HE’S THE
   INEXHAUSTIBLE FOUNTAIN OF LIFE. YOU CANNOT EXHAUST HIS GOODNESS,
   HIS MERCY.

   163 I believe in the baptism of the Holy Ghost. I believe in speaking in tongues, but I think we
   lay too much emphasis on that. A man can speak with tongues, and a woman speak with
   tongues, and if her life and his life doesn’t compare with what tongues you’re speaking in,
   then it’s the wrong tongue, ’cause the Holy Spirit will make you act like the Bible. It’ll bring
   you to the fullness of the stature of Christ. 164 YOU TAKE A PERSON THAT SPEAKS
   WITH TONGUES, ENOUGH TEMPER TO FIGHT A BUZZ SAW, AND TALK ABOUT
   THE NEIGHBORS, AND EVERYTHING LIKE THAT. WHY, YOU CALL THAT THE
   HOLY GHOST? IT CANNOT BE. NO, SIR. 165 THE HOLY GHOST IS MEEKNESS, JOY,
   PEACE, LONGSUFFERING, GOODNESS, GENTLENESS, PATIENCE, FAITH. THE
   HOLY GHOST, THAT’S THE FRUIT OF THE SPIRIT, THAT THE HOLY SPIRIT BEARS
   IN THE CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD, SWEETNESS, AND HUMBLENESS,
   HUMILITY, LOVE ONE FOR ANOTHER, LONGSUFFERING. 166 If a brother has gone
   wrong, don’t just beat him or something another. Go after him and see if you can get him back.
   Don’t wait for the preacher do it. You do it, somebody else. Preacher can’t do it all, neither can
   
   35
   the deacons. Everybody, is a member of this Body of Christ, should go after one another. We
   got…And if we got the Spirit of Christ in us…He taught the great parable. They left the ninety
   and nine, and went after that one. That’s what we’re supposed to do. But we say, “Oh, let them
   go.” We never should do that. We should be gentle, forgiving, longsuffering. That’s the fruit of
   the Spirit. 167 Now, we find ourselves then, that Esther, after she…They put her in one of these
   places, to get herself all fixed up, to make her show before the king. My! She refused it. She
   didn’t want it. She wanted to go out just like she was. Amen. 168 We got today that churches that
   wants to act like the world, or ‘cause we get big. God said, “One time he was little, they served
   Him. But when he got big, then they forgot Him.” That’s right. 169 When we had a tin pan down
   here on the alley somewhere, with a tambourine, beating it on the back of our hands; and an old
   guitar, strummed it; and having a street meeting, you were humble. But when we get to having
   three or four million dollar buildings, and great big things like that, then we get so arrogant we
   forget about that, that’s right, polish up with the world. 170 I was into a place the other day
   where, a holiness brother, there was a bunch of people working for him. And if every woman
   come out of there at coffee time, to take a coffee-break, every woman in there had short hair and
   wearing lipstick. Now, you say, “Brother Branham, you ain’t got no business saying that.” I
   have. The Bible says that. That’s right. 171 Lot of the Pentecostal women wearing clothes that
   pertain to a man, and God said it’s an abomination in His sight. That’s right. How you expect to
   go to Heaven like that? It shows that the Holy Spirit isn’t in there. If the Holy Spirit was in
   there, It’d condemn you. Right. Oh, you might shout, speak with tongues, run up-and-down,
   dance in the spirit. I’ve seen Hindus do that, and Indians, and everything else. THAT DON’T
   MEAN NOTHING, UNLESS THERE’S A LIFE TO BACK UP WHAT YOU’RE TALKING
   ABOUT, POWER OF THE HOLY GHOST, TO MAKE GODLY LIVING PEOPLE. THAT’S
   THE BRIDE OF CHRIST. 172 Esther was to become a bride, so she didn’t want none of the
   adorning of the world. She wanted to go in, to the king, just like she was. She adorned themself
   like the pentecostal women ought to, with a meek humble spirit. And when all these fancy, first
   ladies come by, with all their new fandango things, the king looked at them, and put them in the
   chamber with the concubines. BUT WHEN THIS ESTHER COME INTO HIS SIGHT, AND
   HE GOT A GLIMPSE OF THAT SWEET, HUMBLE, MEEK SPIRIT, HE SAID, “THAT’S
   HER. GO GET THE CROWN AND PUT IT ON HER HEAD.” That’s it. 173 Let them adorn
   themselves with that kind of a spirit, not only the women, but the men, too, adorn themselves with
   that kind of a spirit. THEN YOU’RE BECOMING READY FOR THE—THE BRIDE,
   SWEET, REVERENT. ESTHER MADE HER HEART CLEAN. 174 There’s so much we take
   care of, this outside, oh, it’s got to have so many wrinkle removers, and so much of this, to—to

   63-0120M - The Voice Of God In This Last Days
   William Marrion Branham
   103 Paul, a self-styled Pharisee, just as full of theology as he could be, but one day he heard the
   Voice of God. He saw a Pillar of Fire, and he knowed there was something different. It changed
   his life. No matter how many Pharisees, how many Gamaliels or anything else could cry out to
   Paul, “you’re wrong, you’re wrong,” Paul had heard the Voice of God, he knowed It was the
   Truth. 104 Peter, religious as he could be, keeping the traditions of the elders, he would not eat
   any meat. No, sir. He would have nothing to do about it at all. He was really keeping the
   
   36
   traditions of the elders, right to the Word. What happened? One day he heard the Voice of God,
   “Don’t call that common and unclean, when I make clean.” He was a changed man. He was
   ready to go anywhere the Lord sent him. 105 Closing, I might say this. There was a man one
   time who was a believer. He had been dead four days. He was in the grave, stinking, rotten, but
   he heard the Voice of God speak, “Lazarus, come forth!” And if It brought a man forth after
   being dead and rotten, what ought It to do to a church that still has life in it? It ought to
   resurrect them, in the mess of all of these voices that we’ve talked about, religious, politics,
   Hollywood, all the false prophecies and things that’s gone out. In the midst of all of it, the true
   Voice of God will call a man, that’s dead in sin and trespasses, to life again. It ought to take a
   backslidden church and call it to life again. Sure! 106 Remember, in closing, I say this, and
   then I’ll close. Jesus said, “The time would come, when all that was in the grave would hear the
   Voice of God.” And you’re going to hear It. No matter what condition you’re in, you’re going
   to hear It anyhow. And some of them that come out of the grave, will come to condemnation.
   They hear the Voice, but It’s condemning. And if you hear It today, “Today, after so long a
   time, when you hear My Voice, harden not your hearts, as you did in the days of provocation.”
   And if you, Pentecostal people grouping yourself out in creeds again, in worldliness, “having a
   form of godliness and denying the Power thereof,” before you have to rise in the resurrection
   to be condemned, because the Voice of God that speaks to you now through the Word will
   condemn you in that day. 107 If you’re just a lukewarm believer, the Voice of God cries in your
   heart this morning, “You are a lukewarm believer,” you’d better repent! 108 You men, women,
   boys or girl, that’s not living for Christ, and the Voice of God speaks to you through His Word
   and says “stop doing that,” you better do it. Because you’re going to hear It again one day,
   and It’ll condemn you. You can’t deny It, It’s speaking to you now. And, remember, it’s
   recorded. 109 And those who does right and hears His Voice, will rise to righteousness, to
   Glory, to Heaven. 110 So you’re going to hear the Voice of God some time. Maybe faintly this
   morning It speaks in your heart, that you should turn from the way that you’re going, turn back
   to God. Now, remember, they’ll record that Voice that’s speaking to your heart, in Heaven.
   And someday when Jesus does call, and all that’s in the grave, all, right and wrong, will rise.
   And then this very same Voice will whisper right back to you, “In Phoenix, Arizona, on a
   certain Sunday morning, when the minister held you so long, speaking on the Voice, I spoke to
   you; told you women to let your hair grow out, quit dressing immorally; told you men to quit that
   lying, smoking; told you preachers to turn back to the Word of God.” See what I mean? That’s
   right. That still Voice say, “It could be right.”
   I don't know about you, but I can't have much happiness and as much peace in this
   hour. When I see my children, I know I want them to go in the rapture. I see my friends that I
   love; I want them to go in the rapture. And yet I see our carnality. I see our shortcomings and it
   just scares me. It just scares me. Now I don't want to hold you too long, I am just kind of getting
   carried away tonight for some reason or other.
   Please listen Friends, I’m dead serious to what I’m saying. You remember this. I’m not
   saying it is, but I’m saying the Bible is saying it, and it looks like it is. It looks like the Blood has
   left the Mercy Seat, months and months ago, according to the Scriptures. I’m not saying it is. I’m
   saying the Scripture says that it is. Because when the seals were opened the Lamb did leave the
   Mercy Seat and it did come, smoking.

   And then why did the whirlwind from God in the presence of fifteen men...? And I can
   take you to Tucson and let you meet them that were there. When the whirlwind came down from
   heaven, brother, and smote the mountain and blowed rock boulders and everything out, and a
   prophet of God went out and took off his hat, and boulders falling everywhere, and men jumped
   under pick-up trucks and jeeps and everything and those stones just hitting everywhere. He
   walked right out and took his hat off and stood there with them rocks flying everywhere and that
   big whirlwind just whipping and tearing trees and everything out of the roots of the ground. And
   then that set "Judgment!" Come on now.

   10 In this case, He had three men, Peter, James, and John. And He was just about to reveal
   something that He was going to do. God always, before He does anything, He always sends a
   forewarning of it. And may I say here, that’s the reason that we’re here tonight. And that’s the
   reason that great efforts for a revival is made the world over; God’s getting ready to do
   something. And always before judgment He sends mercy. And if you spurn mercy, nothing’s left
   but judgment. For you have judged it the way you have regarded the message. You refuse the
   message, nothing left but judgment. But God always shows beforehand what He’s going to do.

   Those who died then BEFORE THE LAMB WAS APPLIED, THE BLOOD, it was different.
   Yes, sir. They went on because of good conscious. They would be judged whether they—they
   were… 142 If they were predestinated, it struck them. If it didn’t, it don’t. That’s all. It’s just
   God. “He—He justifies who He will, have mercy on who He will, and He condemn who He
   will.” He is God. That’s all. “He has mercy on whom He has mercy, and condemns who He
   wants to condemn.”
   When mercy is rejected... I would like to ask you Christian people, what is next? What’s
   next? Judgment. Why, then? Why then is all these earthquakes ready to take place? Why? It’s
   because John seen the room smokey, with lightning’s and thunders and judgments. Oh, Friend,
   let me tell you something. If we could only get a revelation of that, it would turn our knees to
   water, if we knew what was coming upon this place. Where that messenger walked, and opened
   up the... by the revelation from God and brought the teaching of the sixth seal, he started
   crying. And he said, "O Lord, don't make me tell them, don't make me tell them." And he wept
   and he cried, and he said, "I can't bear to tell them God." And he said, "Let us just sing and be
   happy, I can't tell you, it is too hard." Why was it too hard? Because many will come and holler,
   "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus" and get nothing.

   63-0323 - The Sixth Seal
   William Marrion Branham
   405 Now remember, you…We couldn’t get to the altar. Several held their hands up. Now, see,
   it’s an individual affair, with you. It’s whatever you want to do. See? 406 The hour is so close
   at hand, you ought to be pressing as hard as you could, NOT HAVE TO BE PULLED. See,
   just pressing, trying to get in, “Lord, don’t let me out. Don’t leave me out, Lord. The doors are
   closing; if I can just get in!” See? 407 God will close the door one day. He did in the day of
   Noah, and they beat on the door. [Brother Branham knocks on the pulpit several times—Ed.] Is
   that right? [Congregation says, “Amen.”] 408 Now remember, the Bible said, that, “In the
   seventh watch.” That right? [Congregation says, “Amen.”—Ed.] Some fell asleep in the first
   watch, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh. But, in the seventh watch, there come forth a
   proclamation, a cry, “The Bridegroom cometh! Go out to meet Him.” 409 The sleeping virgins
   said, “Say, I’d like to have some of that Oil now.” 410 The Bride said, “I just got enough for
   myself; just got enough. If you want It, you go pray It up.” 411 Don’t you see the sleeping virgin
   now? Look at the Episcopalian, Presbyterian, Lutheran, and everything, trying to. And the
   trouble of it is, instead of trying to get the Holy Ghost, they’re trying to speak in tongues. 412
   And a lot of them speak in tongues, and is ashamed to come to this church to be prayed for;
   wants me to come to their house and pray for them. You call that the Holy Ghost? That’s
   speaking in tongues, but not the Holy Ghost. See? 413 Now, I believe the Holy Ghost speaks in
   tongues. You know I believe that, see. But there’s a counterfeit to It, too. Yes, sir. The—the
   fruits of the Spirit, what proves what It is. The fruits of the tree proves what kind of a tree it is.
   Not the bark; the fruit! 414 Now notice, then, when she come, that—that last hour. And there,
   when they come in, then they went and said, “Well, I believe I’ve got It now. I believe I got It.
   Yeah, we’re getting It.” 415 I—I—I’d better not say this, see, ’cause it might cause a confusion.
   When I said the other day, the Rapture, how It would come, I—I…Now, if you say you—you’ll
   take it, all right. [Congregation says, “Amen.”—Ed.] Watch. Watch. All right, that’s up to you.
   416 When the sleeping virgin, see, that thought she was prayed up, to come back, the Bride
   was done gone. It went, and she didn’t know it; like a thief in the night. Then they begin to
   bang on the doors. And what happened? What taken place? They were cast into the
   Tribulation period. The Bible said, “There will be weeping, and wailing, and gnashing of
   teeth.” Is that right? 417 When it’s going to be, brother, sister, I don’t know. But, I—I, me, it
   may be just me here, now, see. This, this is what…This is my thought. See? I—I—I believe it’s so
   close, I—I’m…Each day I—I want…I’m just trying to walk as softly as I can. See? And now
   when, you know, when the… 418 Something happened today, and I seen something come up.
   I—I just…I couldn’t get my breath anymore, see. There He was, standing there, that little
   Light standing right there. And here It was. I know it’s the Truth. 419 I THOUGHT, “O GOD,
   I COULDN’T SAY THAT. I—I CAN’T SAY THAT. I CAN’T.” I just walked out of the room,
   went out, walked up-and-down. Brother, I thought, “My! What can I do? Oh!” See? And I—I
   have to go fishing, or something, or I…Boy, you’d…you…I can’t tell you. See? 420 SO, WE
   HAVE A GOOD TIME. DON’T WE? Praise the Lord! Amen! See? We’re in a—we’re in a
   tremendous time, see, for my heart is overflowed with happiness and joy. 421 But when I think
   of this world and the thousands that I know that’s lost, black-shadowed, hum, then your heart
   just bleeds. “What can you do? What can you do?” You just feel the Holy Spirit crying out, in
   your heart. Like it must have been in our Lord, when He looked over Jerusalem, His Own
   
   39
   people, see, said, “Jerusalem, Jerusalem, how oft would I have hovered you, as a hen would her
   brood, but you would not.” You just feel the Holy Spirit say, “How often I would have gathered
   you, see, but you would not.” See? 422 We’re, we’re right here at something, friends. Whatever
   it is, God knows. Nobody, nobody knows when it’s going to happen. That’s a secret. Nobody
   knows when it’s going to happen. 423 But Jesus told us, “When you see these things, all these
   things.” Just like what I went, comparing with the Sixth Seal, to what He said in Matthew 24.
   Now remember what He said, “When you see these things come, to begin to come to pass, then
   the time is at the door.” Watch the very next verse, the 30—the 30 and 31st verses as went on
   down, 32nd, 33rd verses. 424 He said, “And He shall send forth His angels to the four corners
   of the heavens, to the four winds, to gather His Elected.” Is that right? Said, “Now learn a…”
   425 Now remember, He stopped right there. He never went ahead, after that Sixth Seal. He
   never said anything about the Seventh. He said the First, Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, and
   Sixth. But He stopped there, never mentioned about anything about It. 426 Watch the next
   thing He said, “Now learn a parable.” See? Then He starts on parable. He said, “These things
   will be.” 427 He is answering them three questions. “What will be the… these signs? And what
   will be the sign of Your Coming? What will be the sign, of the end of the world?” 428 And the
   Sixth One, there, was the end of the world. And the sounding of the seventh angel… “Raised up
   the hands, and swore by Him that lives forever and ever, that time shall be no more.” The earth
   is giving birth to a new one. It’s over.
   And I want to tell you this, it also said when that happened, when the mysteries of God
   shall be finished, according to the Revelation 10:7 messenger angel.
   Revelation 10:2-7-Reference quote:
   2 And he had in his hand a little book open: and he set his right foot upon the sea, and his left
   foot on the earth,
   3 And cried with a loud voice, as when a lion roareth: and when he had cried, seven thunders
   uttered their voices.
   4 And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was about to write: and I heard a
   voice from heaven saying unto me, Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered, and
   write them not.
   5 And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to
   heaven,
   6 And sware by him that liveth for ever and ever, who created heaven, and the things that
   therein are, and the earth, and the things that therein are, and the sea, and the things which
   are therein, that there should be time no longer:
   7 But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery
   of God should be finished, as he hath declared to his servants the prophets.
   When those mysteries of the seals of the doctrine of the Apostles and all those loose ends that we
   lost through the Dark Ages are fulfilled in that messenger and prophet, an Angel came down
   from heaven and put His foot upon the Sea and upon the Land and swore by Him that liveth
   forever and ever that time shall be no longer. Then he that is fleshy, let him be fleshy still. He
   that is filthy, let him be filthy still. He that is bound to a denomination, let him stay bound,
   
   40
   because the death angel is in the land striking everything with spiritual death. Can you say,
   "Amen?"
   Brother and Sister, O God, if we could only live up to what the Bible said. If we can only
   make our lives live up to that Word. And then you will make your calling and election sure.

   10 Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if
   ye do these things, ye shall never fall:
   Your calling by God, he said, "Many are called but few are chosen." But when you’re called and
   you are chosen, and you make your calling and election sure, that the word of God is being made
   manifested in you, then your calling and election is sure. But until the Stature of the Perfect Man
   is molded in you...

   off." How much spiritual blindness in here tonight?

   6 And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness;
   7 And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity.
   8 For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor
   unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
   9 But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and hath forgotten that he
   was purged from his old sins.
   
   Eli priesthood—all that they led, blind, leaders of the blind—they’ll all go into the ditch
   of the World Council of Churches. Many independent Pentecostals say, "We’ll never go in." You
   mark this down. When it comes, they’ll say Brother, "I believe that it would be better if we went
   ahead and... 'Cause after all they love God in their own way. And we’ll be able to serve God a lot
   better in there than not be able to serve Him at all." "And they will go hook, line and sinker for
   it," as the messenger said. Is that right?

   30 Don’t just come this far, say, “I believe the Message.” You obey the messenger. Come
   into Christ! You say, “Well, I believe every Word said, Brother Branham.” That’s good,
   but that’s just—that’s just being able to read. 231 Take the Message, take It into your
   
   41
   heart, that you must have the Token, the very Life that was in Christ be in you. “When I
   see That, I will pass over you.” 232 As we see the great end-time signs on earth today, we
   know that that’s right. Now look, I’ve waited for this, for a long, long time, for this Message to
   you. See? And you’ve seen the end-time signs. And I’ve preached It to you, and showed It to
   you, by everything that Christ said. Is that right? [Congregation says, “Amen.”—Ed.] You’ll
   admit that? [“Amen.”] We’re at the end time. I don’t see nothing left. 233 You say, “What
   about the mark of the beast?” Those who reject the Holy Spirit is already marked by the
   beast. The punishment will come later. See?

   65-0801M - The God Of This Evil Age
   William Marrion Branham
   136 In Ephesians 2:2, they are called, “The children of disobedience.” Like Eve was,
   disobedient to God’s Word. The children of obedience, and disobedience, have nothing in
   common. Then how can the Bride of Christ associate in a denomination, when one is disobedient
   and the other obedient? How can one, be the Word; and the other one, perverted word? How
   can a prostitute and a clean woman walk together in agreement? They can’t do it. They have
   no fellowship at all. “Come out from amongst them!” It’s of the devil. It’s the mark of the
   beast. Heading right into it now; all denominations. I don’t care whose it is. God is taking, not
   a denomination, “a people for His Name.” A denomination won’t receive these Truths. It’ll take
   an individual person that can see God, look at His Word and believe It, and belong to no
   organization; but live for God, not for his organization, the intellectual wisdom of some bishop
   or something has taught it. That’s right. 137 The children of disobedience, and the children of
   obedience, has nothing in common. One of the…is of the day of Light; the other one, of night
   and darkness, evil age, this evil age of darkness, nightclubs, dances, yet belong to church. It’s
   okay with their god. They don’t have any condemnation about it; nothing bothers them.
   
   So when, this daughter-in-law of Eli... A man of God came to Eli and told him the news
   that both of his sons were dead. And Eli himself, the remainder of the priesthood, fell over and
   broke his neck when the prophet brought judgment upon him. And then, one of the wives of his
   son was giving birth to a child. And while she was giving birth, she was dying herself. She didn't
   even live long enough to name the child. And so the midwife named the child and she named it
   Ichabod.
   And I would like to say this in closing. “Ichabod,” to every church, to every independent
   church, to every denomination, “Ichabod” is written over the door because of the word of God
   made manifested in this hour, the way of Truth, and they crucified It. And now, as the Jews,
   there is nothing left but blood. And they’ll hunt you down, if we don't make the rapture, they’ll
   hunt you down like a bunch of dogs; the pope, the man of sin, will, and kill you. My brother and
   sister, there’s not one person in here, too old, tonight to see that take place in this very hour. Can
   you say, "Amen?" Ichabod! The Glory of the Lord is departed from this thing.

   63-1229M - There Is A Man Here That Can Turn On The Light
   William Marrion Branham
   211 Look to the promise of this hour, what we’re living in; a rejected Light. What did they?
   They rejected It back there. Why? They was living in a glare. What are they doing today? Same
   thing. 212 Well, are—are you a Christian? “I’m a Lutheran. I’m a Baptist. I’m Presbyterian.”
   That don’t mean one thing. Just might say you was a “hog, pig,” or anything else you want to
   call yourself. See? That, that’s about how much it means. Now no—no disregards to you, but if
   you’re taking it to its fundamental part, that’s right. I asked the question, “A Christian?” That’s
   Christ in you. And if Christ is in you, then the Word is in you. And then if the Word is in you,
   when the Light is shining, how you going to walk out of It? See, that’s the question. That’s
   what’s in now, the Light. The evening Light’s shining. The Bride Tree is blooming. 213 Oh,
   remember, they pruned that old Tree. “And what the cankerworm left, the palm—palmworm eat;
   and what the palmworm left, the caterpillar eaten.” What the Methodist left, the Baptist eaten;
   what the Baptist left, the Pentecostal eaten. He said, “This Tree was,” Joel there, “was cut all
   down to a stump,” but he wanted to know if it would live again. Oh, yeah! He reserved that
   Tree. He reserved that Tree, yes, sir, for it was His Bride. And He said, “‘I will restore,’ saith
   the Lord.” What is it? “I’ll bring it forth, all that the Lutheran eat, and the Wesleyan eat, and all
   them. And I will restore it, ’cause it’s all still in the root of the Tree.” See?
   Now listen, this is my last statement in closing. You’re gonna see this message that I
   preach tonight come to pass. It’s going to come. And it’s not very far off. Some great thing is
   getting ready to happen.

   62-1230E - Is This The Sign Of The End, Sir?
   William Marrion Branham
   359 And then, if this is the continuation, for the sounding of these last trumpets, or these last
   Seven Thunders that’s coming forth, the mysteries, the last Seals, It’ll have to compete, or
   compare, with the rest the Scripture. And if them first Ones in there opened with a blast of
   thunder, the second Ones will, too, that’s on the backside. Watch what happens. If the vision was
   Scripture, then it must be interpreted by the Scripture, or a continuation of the same Scripture.
   360 Notice, Revelation, 3 and 4, “Seven Thunders.” Seven Thunders, and then notice, 3 and 4,
   and then (what?) an oath from that mighty Angel, that, “Time was finished.” When these
   Thunders, you see, brought forth their voices, then the Angel… 361 Just think of it! “An Angel,
   clothed in a cloud, and a rainbow covenant over His head.” Why, you know Who that is. “Put
   one foot on the land, and on the sea, and lift up His hand and swore, that, ‘When them Seven
   Thunders uttered their voices,’ that, ‘time would be no more.’” 362 And if the ministry of the
   mysteries of God is finished, what if that is them seven mysteries coming forth? And a humble,
   little church like ours, that the Almighty has come and regarded the low estate of His people!
   You say, “What? I don’t think so.” It might not be. But what if it is? Then time has run out. Did
   you think it? Be serious. It may be later than we think. 363 These stars falling into their
   
   43
   constellation back yonder! That Angel coming, and said, “As John was sent to wind up the Old
   Testament and to bring forth the introduction of Christ, a Message will wind up the loose ends
   and will introduce the Messiah just before His Coming, the Message of the last days.” 364
   Notice, the mighty Angel swore, with an oath, that, “Time would be no more.” 365 Now, I
   don’t want to keep you too long. Just think of this, a minute now. 366 Now listen. This Angel
   come down from Heaven. See? The other, seven angels of the seven churches, was earthly
   messengers. But this Angel…All the Message is finished; the seventh angel winds up the whole
   thing. And this Angel comes not to the earth; He isn’t a man from the earth, as the messengers to
   the church ages; that’s finished. But, this Angel brings the next announcement. And an angel
   means a “messenger.” And He comes down from Heaven, clothed in that Pillar of Light,
   Cloud, with a rainbow over His head. And a rainbow is a covenant. It was Christ, “With one
   foot on land, and one on the sea, and swore, that, ‘Time will be no more.’” Where are we at,
   sirs? What’s all this about? I’m asking you. 367 The other angels was messengers, men of the
   earth. But this Angel…These, that said, “To the angel of the church of Laodicea,” “To the angel
   of the church of Ephesus,” messengers of the earth; see, men, messengers, prophets, and so
   forth, to the church. 368 But, this One didn’t come from the earth. He come down from Heaven,
   because the mystery is all finished. And when the mystery is finished, the Angel said, “Time
   shall be no more,” and SEVEN THUNDERS THROWED THEIR VOICES OUT. 369 WHAT
   IF IT IS SOMETHING TO LET US KNOW HOW TO ENTER INTO THE RAPTURING
   FAITH? IS IT? WILL WE RUN, LEAP OVER WALLS? AND IS THERE SOMETHING
   FIXING TO HAPPEN, AND THESE OLD, MARRED, VILE BODIES ARE GOING TO BE
   CHANGED? Can I live to see it, O Lord? Is it so close that I’ll see it? Is this the generation?
   Sirs, my brethren, what time is it? Where are we at? 370 Let’s look at the watch, the calendar, to
   see what date we’re living in. Israel is in Palestine, in her homeland. The ensign, the six-point
   star of David (two thousand years ago, yeah, nearly twenty-five hundred years ago), the oldest
   flag, is flying. Israel is back in her homeland. “When the fig tree put forth its buds, this
   generation shall not die, shall not pass out, pass away, until all things are fulfilled.”
   
   As Hannah was given a double portion by her husband, God gave a portion to the
   Pentecostals. Yes, He did.
   He gave a portion to them, they spoke in tongues and they healed the sick and they did
   mighty miracles and then in that day, He said, "Depart from me, ye workers of iniquity, I never
   did know you." Well they said, "Lord, didn't we have all them great meetings and
   everything?" He said, "I don't even know you."

   259 And then when he heard Pastor Moses speak, that day, he said, “But you’ve got to get
   beneath that blood, for God said, ‘The blood is a token.’ It’s a token! No matter how much you
   believed, how much you are circumcised; that’s a covenant God gave to Abraham, and so forth,
   that’s the covenant. But you’ve got to get beneath the blood, that’s a token, for He said, ‘When I
   see the blood, I’ll pass.’ Israelite, or any!” 260 That’s denomination or not denomination,
   
   44
   either one, you must come beneath the Blood. Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian, Pentecostal,
   undenomination, whatever you are, it’s for an individual. YOU’VE GOT TO COME
   BENEATH THE BLOOD. NOW JUST DON’T TALK ABOUT IT; RECEIVE IT! HEAR
   ME! HEAR ME! IN THE NAME OF THE LORD, HEAR ME! SEE? GOT TO COME
   BENEATH THE BLOOD! 261 HE WAS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY PERSONS FROM
   BENEATH THE BLOOD. GOD MADE IT CLEAR THAT ALL FROM UNDER THAT
   BLOOD WOULD PERISH. 262 MAY I USE HIS WORDS? ALL OUTSIDE OF CHRIST
   WILL PERISH. How do you get in Christ? First Corinthians 12, “By one Spirit!” 263 Not, “by
   one handshake, by one membership, by one denomination.” That’s what they’re trying to make
   it. They may do that. 264 “But by one Spirit we are all baptized into one Body.” “If an angel
   from Heaven teaches anything else,” Paul said, “let him be cursed.” That’s the Message, come
   into Christ! 265 Look, any persons outside of the token, God was not responsible. And God is not
   responsible for any person, big or small, popular or unpopular, rich or poor, bond or free, male
   or female; He is not responsible for anybody that’s from under the Token covenant. He’s not
   responsible. 266 YOU SAY, “BUT, O LORD, I’VE DID THIS. I CAST OUT DEVILS. LORD,
   I DID THIS. I—I PREACHED THE GOSPEL.” 267 “DEPART FROM ME, YOU THAT

   this the other night. Deny it and I’ll strike you dead right where you’re standing!””
   Bring great judgment, things like that, see? And they can’t run from that. So what do they
   do? They cry out for mercy, and the preacher cries out like this; ““Now look here, Lord, you

   2. What happened? When the elected bride comes out in a revival with the great power of the
   Holy Ghost and here is the great ones (O.R., J.M., D.N., etc.) great big buildings, great big
   ministries. (they make me sick to my stomach). God never did send a one of them, every one of
   them is false prophets and of the devil. Not in God’s Bible at all.
   3. Here it is, the great power of God demonstrated in the bride and all these converts coming
   out. It shakes them up to their feet, and what do they do? They begin to humble themselves
   down now, when they see they can’t stay with that creative power of God. They duplicated
   healing and all the other gifts and things but here comes something on the scene that they can’t
   imitate. And it begins to get worldwide attention and shake the world. And then they begin to
   come and think that they are gonna fool this guy, that they are just gonna squeeze in on this
   ministry and find out how it operates. BUT, BROTHER, THEY AIN’T FACING THE
   FRIEND OF THE BRIDEGROOM. THEY ARE FACING THE BRIDEGROOM HIMSELF.
   4. HE NEVER IDENTIFIED HIMSELF WITH THE VOCAL CORDS OF BROTHER
   BRANHAM, BUT HE WILL IDENTIFY HIMSELF WITH THESE VOCAL CORDS AND
   SAY, “THIS IS THE LORD JESUS SPEAKING. THIS IS NOT A MAN YOU’RE
   LISTENING TO, THIS IS ME! THE LORD GOD! THE GREAT I AM! THE LORD
   JESUS CHRIST! I’M DOWN IN THIS MAN HERE. Are you coming to get my Token after
   you set in my meetings turned down my prophet William Branham? what are you doing in

   O.R. I got a big university and a great big this or that. And I won thousands to you in Africa and
   India. You know me, Lord. I’m the great ---.

   515 “He is the first fruits of the resurrection.” Is that right? [Congregation says, “Amen.”—
   Ed.] Watch. Then, what is He? “HE IS THE HEAD OF THE BODY, WHICH IS HIS
   CHURCH, BRIDE.” Uh-huh. 516 THEN, THE BRIDE-BODY MUST FOLLOW THE
   HEAD, FOR IT IS PART OF HIS RESURRECTION AND PART OF THE MYSTERY. IT’S
   IMPOSSIBLE FOR IT NOT TO GO. Oh, my! It’s part of God’s mystery, how God revealed
   Himself here and raised It up by the Word, so He reveals the Church and raising It up by the
   same Word. It’s a part of His threefold mystery. 517 As the Head was took from the grave, so
   must the Body follow Him back to Eden. Where, the Head of the family, the Man, the
   Bridegroom; the Bride being the Body of the Bridegroom, must follow, the Bride, because
   
   46
   that’s the Head. AND THE HEAD IS REVEALED, AND COME BACK WITH ETERNAL
   LIFE; AND THE BODY MUST FOLLOW THAT, BECAUSE IT IS HUSBAND AND WIFE
   AGAIN. Amen! And as long as you’re pregnated with the same Word, which is His Body;
   you’ve took His Body, become in Him, when you took the Word. Not the creed; the Word! Oh,
   my! 518 Wouldn’t that make a text for this afternoon, to go on? Huh? My, wouldn’t that be
   wonderful? See? Just think of it now, what it is. 519 Therefore, the Body cannot
   recognize…Don’t you fail this. The Body, therefore, cannot recognize any other headship but the
   Word. Cause, the—THE HEAD IS CONNECTED WITH THE BODY, AND THE HEAD IS
   THE WORD, AND IT’S THE SAME WORD, ONE HEADShip! Therefore, denominations,
   and holy fathers, and everything else, is dead dung. THERE IS ONE HEADSHIP, THAT’S
   CHRIST. THE BODY ONLY RECOGNIZES ONE THING, THE WORD!
   Remember, this Eli Priesthood, is giving birth to a man-child, too. And that is none other
   than, Judas himself. There, the World Council of Churches is going to give birth to a man-child
   too, the man of sin, the devil incarnated in a man.
   But the Man-child given to Hannah is going to be the Word of God made manifested to
   purge the floor of these denominations.

   individual ministry to one here and there, the church here and the church there. When this Man-

   "No, you go and go to the denominations and buy, cause I just got enough for myself to go in the
   rapture." Amen?
   They haven't asked the Bride for It yet. They went out to the Full Gospel Businessmen
   and said, "Give us of It," but they didn't really have it anyway. But the Bible said, they will come
   to the Bride and ask for Oil, and then not get It. And then the Bride will say, "Go on over there

   Let’s just bow our heads now. Before I pray, how many say, "Brother Bob..." Are you
   sure, Friend? Are you sure? That you’re abiding in the message for the hour, in the way that’s
   evil spoken of, or could you possibly, is there a chance that you could be deceived?
   How many tonight would say, knowing that the rapture is close at hand, got all those little
   shady things that you’re doing, don't line up the Word. Those tempers that you can't control, all
   those things that don't line up with the Word. How many...? I got things I want to
   overcome. How many would like to be remembered in prayer? As we pray.
   God, bless your precious hearts. Remember the House of God is a House of
   correction. And a true minister will chastise everything that is not right with the word. Every
   action every motive. As brother Bob Wells said the other night when he read the Scripture,
   "Spare not the rod and spoil the child." And he said, he believed that was kind of like the

   An Exposition Of The Seven Church Ages - 9 - The Laodicean Church Age
   William Marrion Branham
   Now if all the things that the Spirit is crying out against are true of this age, we need someone
   to come on the scene as did John the Baptist and challenge the church as never before. And
   that is exactly what is coming to our age. Another John the Baptist is coming and he will cry
   out exactly as did the first forerunner. We know that he will because of what the next verse says.
   “As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent.” Revelation 3:19.
   This is the same message that John had as he cried out in that religious wilderness of Pharisees,
   Sadducees, and heathen, “REPENT!” There was no other course then; there is no other course
   now. There was no other way to get back to God then, and there is no other way now. It is
   REPENT. Change your mind. Turn around. REPENT, for why will ye die? Let us examine the
   first phrase, “as many as I love.” In the Greek the emphasis is upon the personal pronoun “I.”
   He does not say as many would feel He should say, “as many as love ME.” No sir. We must
   never try to make Jesus the OBJECT of human love in this verse. No! It is the MANY that are the
   LOVED ONES of God. It is HIS love, in question, NOT ours. So once again we find ourselves
   glorying in His salvation, His purpose and His plan, and we are confirmed even more strongly in
   the truth of the doctrine of the Sovereignty of God. Even as He said in Romans 9:13, “Jacob
   have I loved.” Does it now obtain that since He loved ONLY the MANY, is He therefore in a
   state of complacency, awaiting the love of those who have not drawn nigh Him? By no means is
   this so, for He declared also in Romans 9:13, “Esau have I hated.” And in verse 11 the Spirit
   boldly calls out, “For the children not being born, neither having done any good or evil, THAT
   THE PURPOSE OF GOD ACCORDING TO ELECTION MIGHT STAND, not of works, but
   
   49
   of Him that calleth.” This love is “Elective Love.” It is His love for His elect. And His love for
   them is apart from HUMAN MERIT for it says that the purpose of God stands in election
   which is exactly opposite to works or anything man has in himself. Because “BEFORE THE
   CHILDREN WERE BORN” He had ALREADY said, “Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I
   hated.” And now He says to His own, “As many as I love, I REBUKE AND CHASTEN.” To
   rebuke is to reprove. To reprove is to “expose with a view to correction.” Chasten does not
   mean to punish. It means to “discipline because the subject’s amendment is in mind.” This is
   exactly what we find in Hebrews 12:5-11, “And ye have forgotten the exhortation which
   speaketh unto you as unto children, My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor
   faint when thou art rebuked of Him: for whom the Lord loveth He chasteneth, and scourgeth
   every son whom He receiveth. If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for
   what son is he whom the Father chasteneth not? But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all
   are partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons. Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh
   which corrected us, and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto
   the Father of spirits, and live? For they verily for a few days chastened us after their own
   pleasure; but He for our profit, that we might be partakers of His holiness. Now no chastening
   for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the
   peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby.” Herein is now set forth
   the love of God. He desired in love a family of His own, a family of sons — sons like Himself.
   There before Him lies all mankind as ONE lump of clay. Out of that same lump He will now
   make vessels unto honor and unto dishonor. The CHOOSING will be His own choosing. Then
   those chosen ones, born of His Spirit will be trained to conform to His image in their walk. He
   REPROVES with all long-suffering and gentleness and mercy. He CHASTENS with nail
   scarred hands. Sometimes this Potter must take the vessel He is working on and thoroughly
   break it down in order that He may rebuild it exactly as He desires it. BUT IT IS LOVE.
   THAT IS HIS LOVE. ANOTHER WAY OF HIS LOVE THERE IS NOT. THERE CANNOT
   BE. Oh, little flock, do not fear. This age is fast closing. As it does those tares will be bound
   together, and as a three-fold cord is not easily broken, they will have a tremendous three-fold
   strength of political, physical, and spiritual (Satanical) power, and they will seek to destroy the
   bride of Christ. She will suffer, but she will endure. Fear not those things that are coming upon
   the earth, for He “Who loved His own, loveth them unto the end.” John 13:1. “Be zealous and
   repent.” Now this false church has zeal; make no mistake about that. Her zeal has literally been
   that of the Jews, John 2:17, “The zeal of thine house hath eaten Me up.” But it is a wrong zeal. It
   is for the house of their own building. It is for their own creeds, dogmas, organizations, their
   own righteousness. They have put the Word out for their own ideas. They deposed the Holy
   Ghost and made men into leaders. They have put aside Eternal Life as a Person, and make it
   good works, or even church conformity rather than good works. But God is calling for another
   zeal. It is the zeal to cry “I AM WRONG.” Now who is going to say that he is wrong? What is
   it that all these denominations are based upon? — the claim to originality, and that of God, —
   the claim that they are right. Now they ALL cannot be right. In fact NOT ONE of them is right.
   They are whited sepulchres, full of dead men’s bones. They have no life. They have no
   vindication. God has never made Himself known in any organization. They say they are right
   because they are the ones that are saying it, but saying it does not make it so. They need the
   vindicated “Thus saith the Lord” of God, and they don’t have it. Now let me say this here. I
   don’t believe that God is calling only to the false church to repent. In this verse He is talking to
   His elect. They have some repenting to do, too. Many of His children are still in those false
   
   50
   churches. They are those of whom it speaks in Ephesians 5:14, “Awake thou that sleepest, and
   arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.” To be asleep is not to be dead. These are
   sleeping amongst the dead. They are out there in the dead denominations. They are floating
   along with them. God cries out, “WAKE UP! Repent of your folly.” Here they are lending their
   influence, giving their time and their money, actually their very lives to these antichrist
   organizations, and all the while thinking it is all right. They need to repent. They must repent.
   They need to have a change of mind and turn toward truth. Yes, this is the age that most needs
   to repent. But will it? Will it bring back the Word? Will it again enthrone the Holy Spirit in
   men’s lives? Will it again revere Jesus as the ONLY Saviour? I say not, for the next verse
   reveals the astounding and shocking truth of the close of this age.
   
   Brother Lambert prays closing prayer:
   O Lord God, How I thank You for these precious people, that has come out to hear such
   a poor preacher as myself. Oh God, I believe these things with all of my heart. I seen you stand
   and manifest and vindicate God, these great truths Lord, spoken of in your word for this
   hour. Not one time did it ever fail. And, God, we’re hanging on Lord, and we’re believing, Lord.
   Though we’re talked about, misunderstood…Oh Jesus like Hannah, God, help us,
   Lord. Bring that thing, Lord, whatever it is, that pressure, that persecution, God, that’ll help us to
   have birth pains and travail and agonize. Say, "God, God, let me be a Manifested Son." Oh Lord,
   won't you make us a Manifested Son?
   But Lord, many of us want to be a manifested son with the power of God but we
   overlook the Christian character that we have to have first. Oh God, help us, Lord. Won't you
   develop Christian character in us, Lord, that we might truly be a Manifested Son that is meek as
   a lamb and harmless as a dove. For God, Thy Portion, Thy Spirit won't rest upon a wolf spirit, it
   has to come upon a lamb. A lamb, Lord, never strikes back. It never bawls out, screams out,
   Lord. It’s just led as a lamb to the slaughter, meek and quiet, kind, sincere, full of love, honest
   and upright, full of the Character of Christ.
   Oh God, when we read these things that we have to cry out, "Purge my soul, purge us,
   Lord, and clean us up and make us ready for that great Move of God that is getting ready to take
   place. Help us, Lord, not a one to miss it." Oh God, I love these precious people, I pray that
   You’d help them, each one. Help me most of all, Lord. In Jesus' Name. Amen.
   Let’s sing a little hymn, now. Now, it’s fifteen till ten. We’re gonna sing one hymn and
   then be dismissed. We’ve kept you long, I know you’re hot. But I’m sorry I preached long. I was
   just trying to... I thought I could finish that in about thirty minutes. A better preacher, he could
   have preached it in fifteen, I guess, and done better too.
   Do you love everybody? Say, "Amen." Remember, if you don't love me, you can't make
   it there anyway. That’s right. Only perfect love is going there. Won't be no fussing there, won't
   be no tempers there, just love. And remember, not one person in heaven, not one person in that
   rapture... As I preached on the radio years ago, one of the first times I ever preached, just kind of
   jumped up out of me. And I said, "All you out there in radio land, that says, 'I am going in the
   rapture,' and live like a devil." I said, "There is no perfection beyond the grave." No.

   55-1009 - The Way To Have Fellowship
   William Marrion Branham
   18 I’d rather have a church… Listen, just a moment. I would rather have a church that knows
   nothing about any spiritual gift, and just be so in love with each other and with Christ, I’d
   rather have that than every spiritual gift operating in the church. Now, that might sound hard
   in a Pentecostal group, but I would rather have it. Where there is gifts, they’ll fail. Where there
   is gifts, they’ll bring confusion. Where there is gifts, they can be questioned. But where there is
   love, it is perfect. That’s right. And if you had perfect love you’d have perfect gifts. That’s
   right. So work first with love. That brings fellowship, and fellowship brings gifts.

   Seeking Love 4/8/73 Pm
   Robert Lee Lambert
   Now what are you seeking? Criticism and fault -- or are you seeking love? Well, I don't believe
   anything's gonna go in the rapture -- I believe all who go out of here in the out resurrection
   from all the dead church members will have to seek love. 'Cause nothing's gonna enter that
   place of the redeemed without love -- perfect love.
   
    What kind of spirit you’ve got here now... Remember, you show me what you talk about
   during the day, and by your conversation reveals the condition of your spirit? That’s right! You
   prove what your spirit is by what you say. Did you know that? If you’ll just be quiet and just
   watch and listen, you’ll see how unspiritual people really are. Because the Bible said, "A fool
   makes manifested the whole council of his heart." That’s right.
   Proverbs 18:2-Reference quote:
   2 A fool hath no delight in understanding, but that his heart may discover itself.
   We hear all these things just coming up out of us, just contrary to the Word. It’s
   fearful. Many times, something would jump out of me. I’ll speak short to my wife or something
   and I say, "God, have I really got it?" And then, that’s when I believe in a purgatory. Get down
   
   52
   and fast and pray and purge that thing out of that spirit. Now when it is out of there, you’ve
   gained a great victory. But if you just let it go...
   You remember this, many are saying, "Think of how we are going to be used of God out
   in the ministries and everything." And all of these things are popping up in our lives, daily, and
   we keep putting it off, keep putting it off and we’re going to overcome it. And you know
   what? You will be right in the tribulation, cause that is the way second resurrection spirits are,
   brother Bob, they say, "Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow." Another day passes, "Tomorrow,
   tomorrow." And the next step you know, you’re in the tribulation and the rapture is gone with
   nothing but pure Love. You know what pure Love is now, meek as a lamb and harmless as a
   dove.
   Now, you be honest. I love somebody that is honest. The Bible says, "Confess your faults
   one to another." Can there be one person in here tonight, raise your hand and say, "I am as meek
   as a lamb and harmless as a dove?" And remember the Spirit of the dove does not rest upon a
   wolf. It comes upon a lamb. And he forfeits all of his wool. That’s the only thing that he has, is
   wool. And I tell you, he forfeits that. And you know what that is? That’s your evil nature. You
   give it up, the desires of it, the pride of it, the jealousy of it, the temper of it. You just forfeit it
   over and say, "O God, make me as meek as a lamb and harmless as a dove." How many like to
   be like that? Do remember, Jesus is ready to appear among His Bride.
   I would like to sing a little Dove song tonight. My son asked me if I would please sing
   it. So, we’re going to sing this little hymn and then we’re... I’m going to dismiss you. If Brother
   Bob Wells has anything to say, I’ll dismiss you right after this, because I know many of you are
   weary and tired and we don't want to hold you. And let us in our hearts, let us pray that our spirit
   as we sing this song, God will help us to be the kind that a dove could come and rest upon.

    Let’s remain standing for a word of prayer. How many would like to be remembered in
   prayer this morning?
   Opening Prayer by Brother Lambert:
   Great Jehovah God, we’re so thankful to come out to this little place that we’ve set aside
   Lord. Being driven out of denominations father because of wanting to stay with your Word.
   We’re assembled here this morning as trophy’s God of the great Shout message of Malachi, 4
   thy messenger and prophet sent to this last church age father. Lord truly our hearts does burn
   within us when we can feel the love of God being shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost.
   For Lord, it is truly written in your word, how can two walk together except they be agreed? And
   Lord, when we’re in agreement and we’re fellowshipping around the blood of Jesus Christ and
   by the flesh of his word, then Lord this makes our hearts burn within us, Lord. And Lord, our
   hearts are rejoicing to see what thou art doing here in Connecticut father. And Lord, how we
   thank you father God for this great evening light hope. That Lord In this hour of total darkness
   Lord, getting ready to be total darkness, when the churches go into an apostate World Council of
   Churches, father. Lord, this great light of the shout of Malachi 4, lights our pathway. And we’re
   walking in the light with one another hand in hand with thy Word.
   And father God, we’re so thankful that we can trust in the finish works of Jesus Christ.
   Lord it used to be, before the cross at Calvary and the blood of Jesus Christ, it was, if you will, if
   you will, but now Lord this beautiful melody sings to our hearts, I’ve already done it. So, Lord
   we thank you for your finished works this morning and we know that we’ll be there, because you
   promised us. We know that thou art holding onto our hand, Lord, and we thank you for it. We
   can’t fail, we can’t fall, because thou art with us. Now Lord, I pray that you’d bless each and
   every one here this morning.
   Lord, how we thank you father for the grace you’ve given Brother John, in this hour of
   trial. Lord, may he stand like a real little soldier. May God you’d give him the right words to
   speak when he has to speak and may you bless him and anoint him for this hour that he’s come
   to. In Jesus Christ name, Lord.
   Now father, I need your help real much this morning. I pray Father God that you’d help
   me be able to break your message down to your people here this morning by the help of the Holy
   Spirit, in whom I’m trusting in. In Jesus name, Amen.
    You may be seated. I look out and see are Brother Malison with us this morning.
   We…our hearts sure rejoice to see him with us this morning. I might not have known him,
   because the last time I seen him he had a beard and a… but a… we’re sure glad to see him this
   morning. And a…He got away yesterday over to my brother’s house before I got to see him.
   When I come out of the room and I was ready to go up to see him and he had already left. But
   we’re glad to see you this morning Brother Malison. I know that our hearts are burning within us
   to see your precious appearance here this morning. And we thank each one of you for being here
   2
   this morning. We have another precious couple with us this morning and that is Brother Howie
   Aitken’s mother, and her sister, is here this morning. So, were very thankful for each and every
   one that’s in our midst this morning.
    Now we’re not here to show off our clothes, if we have a new suit this morning, or new
   dress. We’re not here for that this morning but we are here, because of the word of God. We’re
   come here this morning to examine ourselves to see if we’re lining up with the Word for the hour
   that we’re living in. Then, if we know that we are, then we know that we’re pleasing Him. And if
   we please Him, then what-so-ever we ask in His name He’ll do it. Isn’t that wonderful?
   John 14:13-14-Reference quote:
   13 And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in
   the Son.
   14 If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it.
   Now you pray for me, I studied so much yesterday. Because I kept on studying so much
   then when I got to put it all of it down, I just had so much in my mind, I tell yeah, by ten o’clock
   or so, I still hadn’t got my notes ready. I was so exhausted. I told Shirley, “I just can’t stand no
   more, I’m just going to bed.” So, I went to bed and got up early this morning and tried to… In
   prayer and tried to scribble down a bunch notes. Now, I have a bunch of scribbling here, but I tell
   yea… I want to try to show you something by the help of the Lord, that Brother Branham
   brought out, and break it down to you and it’ll sure take the Holy spirit to do it this morning.
   But now, without further or do, if you’ll open your Bibles to Amos 3:7 Let’s read number
   six.
   Amos 3:6-7-Reading:
   6 Shall a trumpet be blown in the city, and the people not be afraid? shall there be evil in a city,
   and the Lord hath not done it?
   7 Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.
   Now so help me, I did not know that sixth verse was there. I didn’t know it, see… now
   isn’t that something. And I wasn’t even gonna read this scripture because I knew it by heart
   anyway, and I was just going to quote it to you. Now, in a minute you’ll see why the Lord had
   me read this. “Shall a trumpet be blown in the city, and the people not be afraid?” Here it now!
   “shall there be evil in a city, and the Lord hath not done it? Surely the Lord God will do nothing,
   but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.”
   Now, let’s look at that a minute. God said, that He wouldn’t do anything unless He
   revealeth … if there was gonna be a Trumpet sound in the city, and He was gonna do a… and
   there was gonna be something done. He would not do it until He revealeth to His servants, the
   prophets.

   54-0512 - The Seven Church Ages
   William Marrion Branham
   141 “Trumpet.” Trumpet is an “announcement.” Gabriel, at the Coming of the Lord, shall
   sound the trump of God. This was God’s trumpet blowing. In other words, He is fixing to
   announce the Eternal destination of the world. A trumpet, what is it? “Get ready. I’m going to
   give you the Revelation of Jesus Christ, to give to the Church. I’ll speak to you, what will be
   the destination of the world, for those who receive and those who reject.” 142 A trumpet of
   God. “Attention!” Every man, when the trumpet blows, he grabs his sword and stands to a
   place, attention. The trumpet!
   Now look at me here a minute. “Amos 3:7, God will do nothing unless he reveals it to his
   servants the prophets.” Now, I quoted that scripture many times but I didn’t get the quickening
   of the spirit of what it said.
   Now just think a minute. Now if He said, He wouldn’t do nothing except He revealed it.
   That means God was getting ready to do something. If He reveals something to a prophet, the
   something is not there yet that He wants to reveal to you. He wants to reveal it to you, but it’s not
   there yet. Do you get it?
   But He said, He would reveal it to His servants, the prophets, and when He does, then
   look for it, it’s on the way! Do you see it?

   An Exposition Of The Seven Church Ages - 9 - The Laodicean Church Age
   William Marrion Branham
   Now the age in which we are living is going to be a very short one. Events are going to
   transpire very rapidly. So the messenger to this Laodicean Age has to be here now, though
   perhaps we don’t know him as yet. But there will surely have to be a time that he becomes
   known. Now I can prove that because we have Scripture that describes his ministry. First of
   all, that messenger is going to be a prophet. He will have the office of a prophet. He will have
   the prophetic ministry. It will be based solidly on the Word because when he prophesies or has
   a vision, it will always be “Word oriented” and it will ALWAYS come to pass. He will be
   vindicated as a prophet because of his accuracy. The proof that he is a prophet is found in
   Revelation 10:7, “But in the days of the voice of the seventh messenger, when he shall begin to
   sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as He hath declared to His servants the
   prophets.” Now this person, who in this verse is called an “angel” in the King James version is
   NOT a heavenly being. The sixth trumpeting angel, who is a heavenly being, is in Revelation
   9:13, and the seventh of like order is in Revelation 11:15. This one here in Revelation 10:7 is
   the seventh-age messenger and it is a man, and he is to bring a message from God, and his
   message and ministry is going to finish the mystery of God as declared to His servants, the
   prophets. God is going to treat this last messenger as a prophet BECAUSE HE IS A
   PROPHET. That is what Paul was in the first age, and the last age has one, too. Amos 3:6-7,
   “Shall a trumpet be blown in the city, and the people not be afraid? Shall there be evil in a
   city, and the Lord hath not done it? Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but He revealeth His
   4
   secret unto His servants the prophets.” It was in the end-time period that the seven thunders of
   Jesus came forth. Revelation 10:3-4, “And cried with a loud voice, as when a lion roareth: and
   when he had cried, seven thunders uttered their voices. And when the seven thunders had
   uttered their voices, I was about to write: and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me,
   Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered, and write them not.” What was in those
   thunders no one knows. But we need to know. And it will take a prophet to get the revelation
   because God has no other way of bringing out His Scriptural revelations except by a prophet.
   The Word always came by a prophet and always will. That this is the law of God is evident by
   even a casual search of Scripture. The unchanging God with unchanging ways invariably sent
   His prophet in every age where the people had strayed from Divine order. With both the
   theologians and the people having departed from the Word, God always sent His servant to these
   people (but apart from the theologians) in order to correct false teaching and lead the people
   back to God. So we see a seventh-age messenger coming, and he is a prophet. Not only do we
   see this messenger coming here in Revelation 10:7, but we find that the Word speaks of Elijah
   coming before Jesus returns. In Matthew 17:10, “And His disciples asked Him, saying, Why
   then say the scribes that Elias must first come?” And Jesus said, “Elias truly shall first come,
   and restore all things.” Before the coming of our Lord, Elijah must come back for a work of
   restoration in the church. This is what Malachi 4:5-6 says, “Behold, I will send you Elijah the
   prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord: and he shall turn the
   heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come
   and smite the earth with a curse.” There is absolutely no doubt that Elijah must return before
   the coming of Jesus. He has a specific work to accomplish. That work is the part of Malachi
   4:6 that says “he will turn the hearts of the children to their fathers.” The reason that we know
   this is his specific work to do at that time is because he has already accomplished the part that
   says “he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children,” when the Elijah ministry was here
   in John the Baptist. Luke 1:17, “And he shall go before Him in the Spirit and power of Elijah,
   to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the Just;
   to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.” In the ministry of John the “hearts of the
   fathers were turned to the children.” We know that because Jesus said so. But it does not say
   that the hearts of the children were turned to the fathers. That is yet to take place. The hearts of
   the last-day children will be turned back to the Pentecostal fathers. John got the fathers ready
   for Jesus to welcome the children into the fold. Now this prophet upon whom the Spirit of
   Elijah falls will prepare the children to welcome back Jesus. Jesus called John the Baptist,
   Elijah. Matthew 17:12, “But I say unto you, That Elijah is come already, and they knew him not,
   but have done unto him whatsoever they listed.” The reason that he called John Elijah, was
   because the same Spirit that was upon Elijah had come back upon John, even as that Spirit had
   come back upon Elisha after the reign of King Ahab. Now once again that Spirit will come back
   upon another man just before Jesus comes. He will be a prophet. He will be vindicated as such
   by God. Since Jesus, Himself, in the flesh won’t be here to vindicate him, (as He did John) it will
   be done by the Holy Spirit so that this prophet’s ministry will be attended by great and wonderful
   manifestation. As a prophet, every revelation will be vindicated, for every revelation will come
   to pass. Wonderful acts of power will be performed at his commands in faith. Then will be
   brought forth the message that God has given him in the Word to turn the people back to truth
   and the true power of God. Some will listen, but the majority will run true to form and reject
   him. SINCE THIS PROPHET MESSENGER OF REVELATION 10:7 WILL BE THE
   5
   SAME AS MALACHI 4:5-6 he will be naturally like Elijah and John. BOTH WERE MEN
   SET APART from the accepted religious schools of their day. Both were men of the wilderness.
   Both acted only when they had “Thus saith the Lord,” straight from God by revelation. Both
   lashed out against the religious orders and leaders of their day. But not only was that so, they
   lashed out against all who were corrupt or would corrupt others. And notice, both prophesied
   much against immoral women and their ways. Elijah cried out against Jezebel, and John
   rebuked Herodias, Philip’s wife. Though he will not be popular, he will be vindicated by God. As
   Jesus authenticated John, and the Holy Ghost authenticated Jesus, we can well expect this
   man will be first of all authenticated by the Spirit working in his life in acts of power that are
   indisputable and found nowhere else; and Jesus Himself, in returning, will authenticate him,
   even as He authenticated John. John witnessed that Jesus was coming, — and so will this man,
   like John, witness that Jesus is coming. AND THE VERY RETURN OF CHRIST WILL
   PROVE THAT THIS MAN INDEED WAS THE FORERUNNER OF HIS SECOND
   COMING. This is the final evidence that this indeed is the prophet of Malachi 4, for the end of
   the Gentile period will be Jesus, Himself, appearing. Then it will be too late for those who
   have rejected him. In order to further clarify our presentation of this last-day prophet, let us
   particularly note that the prophet of Matthew 11:12, was John the Baptist, who was the one
   foretold in Malachi 3:1, “BEHOLD, I WILL SEND MY MESSENGER, AND HE SHALL
   PREPARE THE WAY BEFORE ME; AND THE LORD, WHOM YE SEEK, SHALL
   SUDDENLY COME TO HIS TEMPLE, EVEN THE MESSENGER OF THE COVENANT,
   Whom ye delight in: behold, He shall come, saith the Lord of Hosts.”
   How many times did you quote that and didn’t know that, see? So, God said now if He’s
   gonna do something in the city, if the Trumpet… the Seventh Trumpet is gonna sound, He’ll
   reveal it to His servant, the prophet. Amen! All right.
    Now, we’ll turn over now in Thessalonians 4:16. “For the Lord himself shall descend
   from heaven with a shout” Here’s that prophet right there revealing that. Is that right?
   “with the Voice of the archangel, and with the Trump of God.” There’s that Trumpet, there’s that
   Trumpet! “and with the Trump of God, the dead in Christ shall rise first.”
   1 Thessalonians 4:16-Reference
   16 For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with A SHOUT, WITH THE VOICE of
   the archangel, AND WITH THE TRUMP OF GOD: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:

   129 Now I want you to notice a great thing taking place here now. Don’t miss this. See? Now
   notice. The Word says here, in Second Thessalonians, that there is three things. Notice. From the
   13th to the 16th verse, there is THREE THINGS THAT HAS TO HAPPEN BEFORE THE
   LORD HIMSELF APPEARS. Quickly now, so we can close. See? The first thing
   happens…Notice: A SHOUT, A VOICE, A TRUMPET. Let’s read It now and see if that’s right.
   See? For the Lord himself (16th verse) shall descend from heaven with a shout, and with the
   6
   voice of the archangel, and…the trump of God:… 130 THREE THINGS HAPPENS: A
   voice…A SHOUT, A VOICE, A TRUMPET, has to happen BEFORE JESUS APPEARS.
   Now, a shout…JESUS DOES ALL THREE OF THEM WHEN HE’S—HE’S—HE’S—HE’S
   DESCENDING.
   Now, by the help of the Lord, I want to come at this Seventh Seal at a little different
   angle this Sunday, to try to help you see it a little better.
   So, we see that when the seals we’re opened, it finished the message to the seven
   churches. Amen? It finished the message to the church. And when we look back and see where
   we started at and when we see where we’re at now and what is coming, what the prophet has
   revealed, then that finishes it for that messenger.
   Now the Seventh Seal mystery and the Seven Thunders of the Seventh Seal was saved for
   the Bride.

   493 It was to him, personally. “I say unto thee, thee,” not to them, “to thee, thou art Peter; upon
   this rock I’ll build My Church.” And the word Peter, means “a stone.” Stone means “the
   confessed one,” or, “the separated one.” 494 Upon a certain stone, upon a certain thing; see, a

   “FLESH AND BLOOD NEVER REVEALED IT TO YOU. But upon this revelation, called-out

   it.” 495 “Not one hair of your head shall perish. You are Mine! I’ll raise you up in the last
   day, give unto him Eternal Life, and raise him up at the last days.” There it is, the revelation.

   243 God has always counted character, not members. And today we do vice versa. We count
   members, good dress, well payers, instead of character. Uh-huh. 244 Eliezer sweated it out,
   until he found character. That’s right. Who would he get? And he trusted God. Character for
   what? Character for Isaac, the bride, which the Church is type of. You know that. That was the
   natural seed of Abraham; this is the royal Seed of Abraham. Well, if Eliezer, the messenger
   hunting the bride and trying to find character, if that man is come, a messenger of the last
   day, TRYING TO FIND THE BRIDE FOR CHRIST, he will not look for a denominational
   membership. He will look for character that’s willing. 245 Watch! Good character first, then to
   get her ready to meet Isaac. After he found the character, THEN GET HER STAND STILL
   LONG ENOUGH TO LISTEN TO HIS MESSAGE of Isaac. 246 That’s the messenger of the
   last days, the evening Light, is first find that Church (WHERE WILL THEY BELIEVE THE
   7
   MESSAGE?), hunt it. Can you read what I’m talking about? Hunt where that Church is that’ll
   even let you come in, that won’t close the door in your face. And then when you do there, then
   you’ve found character. Now if she will stand still long enough to tell her how that Bride’s got
   to be dressed! She’s got to be clothed. Stand still! If she could get… 247 Look at the little
   Rebekah listening to every word, her little heart was beating. She…He—he was telling her. Now,
   you’ve sweated it out, “Where will I go?” until I find the character. Then when I find the
   character, then make her stand still long enough to get her ready to go to meet him. Oh, my,
   what a striking thing! (Wish we had a little more time on that clock.) Get her ready; stand still to
   listen to his message of him. Eliezer wasn’t speaking of hisself, but he was speaking of the one
   he was sent from. And he had the gifts to prove that he was sent from him. Amen! He wanted to
   clothe her with these things. You know how he fixed her up. 248 If I could just get her to wash
   her face! See? You know, I—I just felt checked on that, so I better keep still. Anyhow, I’ve said
   enough, you know what I’m talking about. All right, listen, just stand still. 249 NOTICE, THE
   END-TIME MESSENGER, HIS JOB WILL BE TO GET THE SAINTS READY, THE
   BRIDE READY FOR THE BRIDEGROOM. THAT WILL BE HIS MESSAGE. Now you
   want to learn ABC’s so you can study algebra later? When these other SEALS ON THE BACK
   IS OPENED THEY’LL ONLY BE REVEALED TO THEM. That’s right. Learn ABC first.
   What is ABC? “Always Believe Christ,” (not your creed), Christ. See? Believe what He says, not
   what somebody else says. 250 If it’s contrary, if a man tells you, “It’s all right for you to cut
   your hair, women,” you know he’s lying. The Bible says it’s wrong. If he says, “You can be
   deacon and still have four or five wives,” he’s lying. That’s contrary to the Word. See? All these
   other things that we speak of, call it to the Word and see if it’s the Word right. 251 Bring back
   the church to the Word. Now, what is this messenger of Malachi 4 to do? Restore back the
   original Faith, the resurrection Faith. That, they seen Jesus after He had raised from the dead,
   seen Him working among them. 252 They were men of few words. They went forth and preached
   the Word. Oh, they preached long, Paul preached all night one time. See? A man fell out of the
   building, killed himself. He laid his body over him, brought him back to life again, see. See? See,
   kept on preaching. 253 Now, notice they were different man than what the Ph., L.L., Q.U.S.T.,
   and ever what you want to call it, is today. What? Separates the messenger and…The Message,
   rather, by the messenger, will separate the believers from unbelievers. Some of them will line to
   It, and some won’t. Some of the Lutheran… Some of the Catholic lined to Luther, some didn’t.
   Some of the Lutherans lined to Methodist, some didn’t. Some lines to Pentecost, and some won’t.
   Some will line with the evening Light, some won’t. 254 How you going to know whether it’s
   evening Light or not? Test it with the Word (not just one Word, ALL THE WORD PUT
   TOGETHER), see whether it’s right or not. Oh, what is it in? Then if this Message bears forth
   the vindication of God performing what He said He would do, AND IT’S LINED WITH THE
   WORD, THEN THE WORD IS VINDICATED LIKE OTHER TIMES AND OTHER
   PROPHETICS DID. 255 Notice when the Message…when…Notice when the Message is
   rejected by the people, and the messenger SEEMS to be completely defeated, he can’t get
   another door, he can’t get a place.
   
   Now, if you notice and if you just watch the Seven Church Ages, when it comes up to the
   Laodicean Church Age, it rebukes the Laodicean church for its lukewarm condition, and they are
   spewed out of the mouth of God.

   134 That’s what the tree put its…forth its first branch, and that’s what happened. And if that tree
   ever puts forth another branch, they’ll write another book of acts behind it. Cause, you see, the
   same Life has got to be in the same thing. 135 So now, today, when we look over our
   denominational churches, Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian, Lutheran, Church of Christ (socalled), and Pentecostals and things, where do we find that? You don’t find it. 136 I will admit
   that the Pentecostals has the closest thing to It, there is, because they’re up here in the
   LAODICEAN CHURCH AGE. THEY HAD TRUTH AND REJECTED IT. THEY GOT
   LUKEWARM WITH IT, AND GOD SPEWED THEM FROM HIS MOUTH. That’s exactly
   according to the Scriptures.
   But now that’s to the Laodicean Church Age, that is not the Bride. The Bride was called
   out of that Laodicean mess.

   And then when the Bride is being called out, how you going to put it out? It’s the revelation of
   the manifestation of the Word made true. And we’re living in that day; praise be to God; the
   revelation of the mystery of Hisself.
   81 Now, the Rapture is only…This Rapture that we’re talking about, is only for the Bride.
   Remember, the Bible said, “And the rest of the dead lived not for a thousand years.” This great
   Rapture! If there’s not a Rapture, friends, where are we at? What are we going to do? What age
   are we living in? What promise do we have? There is going to be a Rapture. The Bible says there
   will be. And it’ll be only for the Elected, the Elected Lady, the Bride in this day, that’s pulled
   out, the Church. 82 The wor-…very word, church, means “called out of.” As Moses called a
   nation out of a nation, the Holy Spirit is calling a Bride out of a church; a Church out of a
   church; members, from every denomination, making up a Bride, Bride tree. It’s in the—in the
   tape, The Bride Tree. A Bride coming out, call, and that’s the one that…the Bride tree is the,
   the Bride, rather, is the one that’s going to be in the Rapture; that, alone, nothing but the
   Bride, the elected ones foreknown by God from the beginning, the Father’s spiritual genes.
   So, then the next thing you see after these things, it’s all over. So, if you look in the third
   chapter then there is no ministry of the Bride at all. And that’s what throws so many people off.
   And Brother Branham didn’t really… I don’t think he… in every message that he
   preached, he wouldn’t place any speaking about the Seven-Seal mystery. He would just tell the
   Laodicean church world, because his tapes would go all over the world… that they’ve had it.
   That they’ve rejected the message, and the rapture takes place.
   But then when the prophet… the Third Pull… when the Third Pull… the opening of the
   Seven Seals now is the Third Pull. That is the Third Pull. That is what the angel told Brother
   Branham. This is not your death, this is the vindication of your ministry, the Third Pull.

   was real shiny. And it was so feather-edge sharp, Oh, my. And I thought, "Isn't that the prettiest

    Alright now, this Seven Seal and the Seven Trumpets is the same. The Seven Trumpets to
   the Jews has the same meaning as the Seventh Seal does to the Bride. The Seventh Seal to the
   Bride is in three folds. It’s the Word, resurrection, and rapture. Now, if you’ll notice the Seventh
   Trumpet is the same to Israel as the Seventh Seal is to the Bride.

   Seventh Seal, that when these souls that was under the altar there, that received robes…They
   were given robes, not that they earned them, because they were in the dispensation when God
   was still dealing with grace with the Gentiles, not Jews. Israel is saved as a nation. God deals

   163 We’re at the homeland. The Jews are in a homeland. We’re at the end of the age, ready for
   the Rapture. The Rapture comes, the Church goes up, we’re caught up to meet Him in the air.
   We all know that. The Stone that was cut out of the mountain, is ready to come at any time.
   And when It comes, what does It do? It does away with the Gentile age. It’s all over, and God
   completely quits dealing with them. “Let him that’s filthy be filthy still; let him that’s holy be
   holy still.” See? What does He do then? He takes His Church, the Holy Ghost filled. 164 What’s
   the “filthy”? That’s the sleeping virgin and them that comes up for judgment, way over in here.
   We’ll get that on another map, when we continue this one over, where she comes up to the White
   Throne Judgment and has to be judged by the redeemed. Paul told us not to take a matter to
   court, because the saints would judge the earth. That’s right. We’re at the end time, here, now.
   [Brother Branham refers to his blackboard drawing—Ed.] All right.

   136 And remember, in that Sixth Seal, where, ALL SEVEN TRUMPETS SOUNDS UNDER
   THAT SIXTH SEAL. When we get to that, you’ll see that. Every (seven) Trumpet took place in
   that Sixth Seal.
    Now when the Fifth Seal was open, we find out that God was driving the Jews back to
   their homeland by these trumpets. Amen! Driving them back to their homeland. Now He started
   that in about 1919 when the third angel and the third war went forth. He started driving the Jews
   back to their homeland. Now they are in their homeland. Amen! They are in their homeland now.
   Now, God by the Seventh Trumpet has the Jews in their homeland. He’s drove them back
   to their homeland and they are ready to receive the Holy Ghost. Now they’re not ready to meet
   the Messiah until they receive the Holy Ghost. So, they’re in their homeland and they’re gonna
   receive the Seal of God, the hundred and forty-four thousand, and they’re gonna meet Jesus
   Christ. And He’s gonna show them the wounds in His hands. Amen!
    Now, the same as the Seventh Trumpet is to Israel, is the same thing as the Seventh Seal
   is to the Bride. He has called us back to the Word, and Christ can’t bless us unless we are back in
   12
   our homeland, the Word! So, He’s called us back into the Word. So that He might bless us with
   and out pouring of the Holy Ghost, and set us in order, an apostolic church in order. Glory to
   God! Just like He’s setting the hundred and forty-four thousand in tribal order.
   Now, don’t you give me none of this, that it’s all over now, see. There It won’t hold up
   again, do you see that? In every service, we just keep nailing that down a little tighter.
    Now, that’s why Brother Branham said on the Seventh Seal, as Israel is set in tribal
   order… he just dropped this off in one word, so has the Bride. So, they miss it, you got to have it
   by a Revelation.

   Oh, my. What are they? They're in tribal order. Yet they are not now, but they will be.
   They're in tribal order. What will be in tribal order? Not the regular Jew. No. But the ones
   that's the elected, the hundred and forty-four thousand will be set in tribal order. Oh, my. How
   I would like to show you. We won't go into it, but that's exactly what the Church has to be:
   right in order.
   So, there we see the Seventh Trumpet is to Israel, is what the Seven Seal is to the Bride.
   Now, we don’t know what the Voice of the thunders is going to utter. But we do see, what some
   of the folds is gonna be. One thing it’s gonna be, it’s going to be a Holy Ghost outpouring, to
   prepare us to meet Jesus Christ in our midst. Because the capstone is going to come into our
   midst. Can you say, Amen? The resurrected saints are going to come into our midst. And before
   the Trumpet of God can sound, the Holy Ghost has to be poured out.
   Because when the Holy Ghost is poured out upon those that are alive and remaining unto
   the coming of the Lord, it shall be such a tremendous outpouring of the Holy Ghost that it will
   cause… It’ll be like a magnet, when the capstone begins to come descending down upon the top
   of the Pyramid, it’s like a magnet and the Holy Ghost is powerful in the Bride. With the capstone
   there it gets so powerful, it keeps building up, more power, more power, more power, more
   power, more power until finally it’s like an elastic rubber band. POW!! It draws the dead from
   the graves and then they begin to appear to us. How many believe that?

   sickness, free from old age, free from everything else; and in the Glory of God, to live in His

   All right. 160 “For I know that my redeemer liveth, and at the last days He’ll stand on this earth;
   though the skin worms destroys this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God; whom I shall see for

   this way. Oh, sure, “crazy,” to the world, for, those things that the world calls crazy, God calls
   blessed. You have to “lose your mind,” to this world, because (why?) you’re not of this world.
   162 When you cross over that separating line, you become fellow citizens of the Kingdom of
   God. Oh, my! How good is it? Why, you become a new creature, (oh, my) changed from this

   places.” Not, “we will be,” in the Millennium. We are now, right now we’re the sons of God.
   “Right now we’re sitting together in Heavenly places, in Christ Jesus,” not just in the church,
   “in Christ Jesus.” 163 The resurrected Lord Jesus is here. He is here in His power. He is here
   in His redemption power. He is here for the exodus. He is here to bring every church member

   laying there, and they swept it out. That big stone come by and picked it, that big magnet stone,
   and picked it all up because it was magnetized to it. We’ve got to be magnetized to that
   Headstone. THAT HEADSTONE IS THE HOLY GHOST, CHRIST. And every one of us has
   got that magnetism of the Holy Spirit. When that Stone strikes the image, the Church will flee
   to It, back into Glory. She will be taken up, at the Rapture of the saints, when She goes forth in
   that day. 141 Now, looky here. We find out, the Jews has now been returning back, for about
   forty years, about the same time that it taken them to run out to the destruction of the temple. It’s
   taken them about forty years to come back, until they re-instruct another temple. See, we’re right
   at the end of the road. Well, if the Gentile… 142 Now let’s take the…We see the Church, the
   coming of the Stone. Let us take the last age. We went through. We see now. I believe I got some
   writing here on that. Let’s see, just a minute. “And the prince that is to come, which is the
   antichrist, will make a covenant with the Jews.” And in Daniel 7…or—or 9:27. “And in the
   middle of the week, three and one half years, the beast will make her covenant…” I—I want to
   get to that one, a little later on, that covenant. We want to leave…I want to start right here now.

   The Bible says, He shall descend from heaven with a Shout, the message of the prophet
   Amen! And the Voice of the archangel! Amen! The Voice of the archangel, The Voice of the
   Bridegroom, and then the Seven Trumpet shall sound and the dead in Christ shall rise first.
   1 Thessalonians 4:16-Reference quote:
   16 For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with A SHOUT, WITH THE VOICE OF
   THE ARCHANGEL, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:
   Then we, which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord, shall not prevent them
   that are asleep. Amen! But the power of the Holy Ghost will be so great that it’ll suck them right
   out of the graves. And they’ll appear among us.
   1 Thessalonians 4:15-Reference quote:

   the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.

   the dead saints which slept in the earth rose up. Note, when Michael gets here, the Voice of the
   Archangel, there will come an hour when he'll anoint the vocal chords of the Son of Man. Come
   on! Get it like it is in the Book! And there will come a loud cry, the Bible doesn't say what He

   Now, just think what power will be on the earth. It will take a Holy Ghost outpouring to suck the
   dead from the graves. When the seventh church age comes up, there is more power. All that
   power unites with the power that's on the earth. They come in and unify that body of Christ.
   15
   Then another wave of glory will strike the earth and the sixth church age pops up out of the
   ground. More power, another wave and the fifth church age pops up. And, when you see old
   Peter and James and John walking around, you'll know one of them mornings Michael and his
   angels is gonna be passing by your house. You know -- between 6 and 9 in the morning. And he's
   gonna come down and slip one over on the devil again. And there will be just a sweep of
   anointing power come over you and all at once your breath will be taken away from you and
   you'll be traveling like a thought.
    Oh, brother, don’t be discouraged, but I’m encouraged. I’m getting ready to see the
   prophet and all of the saints that are sleeping in Christ Jesus. Glory to God! And it will come as a
   thief in the night to the church world, they’ll know nothing about it.

   375 It’ll be, maybe one leave Jeffersonville, just somebody come up missing. They’ll say, “Well,
   you never…” The rest of them won’t know. There’ll be one leave Georgia. See? There’ll be one
   leave in Africa. And let’s say there would be five hundred people, living, will go in the
   translation. Now, that ain’t—that ain’t the church body. This is the Bride. That ain’t the
   church. This is the Bride. See? 376 The—the church will come up by the thousands, but that’s in
   the next resurrection. “They live not for the space of a thousand years.” See? 377 But, in the
   Bride, if five hundred people left the earth this very minute, the world would know nothing about
   it. Jesus said, “There’d be one in the bed; and I’ll take one, leave one.” That’s at nighttime.
   “They would be two in the field,” over on the other side of the earth, “I’ll take one and leave
   one. And as it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be in the coming of the Son of man.” 378
   Think! Everything will move just as common as it can be. A fanatic Message will go by, and,
   the first thing you know, something, “This minister, going somewhere, he never come back.
   He probably went to the woods, hunting. He just never returned no more. And this fellow went
   somewhere. You know what happened? I believe, that young girl, she—she must have been
   caught away somewhere, you know, somebody take that girl out and ravish her, probably
   throwed her in the river. She was with nobody.” Half of it…ninety-nine out of every…May say
   one out of every hundred million will ever know anything about it; see, ’less somebody that’s
   acquainted with her, say, “The girl is missing. Why, I can’t understand. She never did leave like
   that.” No. 379 And when they say, “The—the graves will open.” How is the graves going to
   open? When, I—I haven’t got time to get into this, what I wanted to. I’m going to have to take
   this, see, just to show you the simplicity of God. And that calcium, potash, and everything,
   when—when…Everything that’s in you, of materials, only makes a spoonful. That’s right. And
   what that does, it breaks on back into spirit and life. God just speaks, and the Rapture will
   come. It ain’t going out there, and the Angels come down and shovel up the graves, and get
   out an old dead carcass here. What is it? It was born of sin, to begin with. But, a new One,
   made in its likeness, you know. See? If we have this, we’ll die again. See? Nobody…You say,
   “The graves will open. The dead shall walk out.” That may be true, but not open the way you say
   open. See? That’s right. See? It won’t be like that. 380 It’ll be a secret, because He said He’d
   come “like a thief in the night.” He has already told us this, the Rapture. 381 Then judgments
   16
   will strike; sin, plagues, sickness, and everything. And people will cry for death to take them,
   when the judgment. “Lord, why is this judgment upon us, when You said that there would be a
   Rapture first?” 382 He’ll say, “It’s already come, and you didn’t know it.” See? God hiding
   Himself in simplicity. Oh, my! All right. “That all, that’s already happened, and you knew it
   not.” 383 Why don’t believers believe the simple signs of His Coming?
   Now my! Now we see that the Seventh Trumpet to the Jews is what the Seven Seal is to
   the Bride. All right now, three-folds. One of them could be… now I’m just a… I’ll just say right
   here, that I’m assuming without authority right here. But I just take this from the Bible, and from
   all the tapes. The three folds, the Seventh Seal is in three folds: The Word, the Resurrection, and
   the Rapture. Now the rapture that ends the Bride. And then the Seventh Trumpet carries on over
   to the Jews. Now the Bride, the Gentile church, has been living in the Feast of the Trumpets of
   Pentecost, since the out-pouring of the Holy Ghost. The Jews rejected their atonement, the Word,
   the Messiah, Christ! The Gentiles receive it, and we’ve been going through a space of time
   waiting for the last three and a half years of the 70th weeks of Daniel. Now, the Gentiles don’t
   have any time allotted to them. But the Jews have got a time piece. Now the Gentiles has been
   living on the Feast of Pentecost. We’ve been feasting by the Holy Ghost now since the early
   church. But now we’ve come up to the place where it’s time for the Gentiles, the cup of iniquity
   to be fulfilled. Now, when is the cup of… the Gentile’s cup of iniquity for the Gentiles fulfilled?
   When you see the denominational church world and Pentecost go into the black out, which is the
   Catholic Church, the World Council of Churches, there is the cup of iniquity is full. And when
   the cup of iniquity is full, God promised that at that time the Trumpet of God would sound and
   the dead in Christ would rise, and the gospel would go to Israel. Do you see it?
   Now, we’re going to look in the Word for some of this. Now we find that in this threefold of Seventh Seal is where the seven unknown thunders sound their Voice. Now this is
   Revelation 10:1. I don’t want to try to get to a preaching to you, I just want to kinda try to teach
   this to you, if I can. It’s hard for me to keep calm.
   Revelation 10:1-3-Reading:
   1 And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven, clothed with a cloud: and a rainbow
   was upon his head, and his face was as it were the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire:
   2 And he had in his hand a little book open: and he set his right foot upon the sea, and his left
   foot on the earth,
   3 And cried with a loud voice, as when a lion roareth: and when he had cried, seven thunders
   uttered their voices.
   Now, I say this could very well be the Voice of the Archangel, because the archangel is
   Christ! Amen! So, this Voice of the Archangel could be the same Voice in 1 Thessalonians 4:16
   “For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel”.
   Now, when He descends with the Voice of the Archangel, He utters the unknown
   thunders to the Bride. The Seven Unknown Thunders to the Bride, is to prepare the Bride, like
   the Seventh Trumpet prepares Israel. When the Seven Unknown Thunders utter their Voices it
   will bring revival to the Bride and the setting in order of the church, an apostolic church. He’ll
   set that in order. And it will bring judgement to the apostate church world and a vindication of
   Malachi 4:5, the opening of the seals.

   48 The Seven Seals holds the mystery of the Book. Until we can see what those Seven Seals has
   sealed in, we’re only presuming them things. Because, as I’ve told you, this morning, upon my
   little Message this morning, of God hiding in simplicity. You see, we—we are…We are sure to
   miss the thing unless It is absolutely, genuinely revealed by the Holy Spirit, and vindicated the
   same. See? If the prophet rises and tells you that This is just That, and God don’t vindicate the
   same, forget it. See? But God, in every statement, in everything, has to vindicate It, to make It
   right. See? So, His children will watch those things, see, and be alert, notice. 49 Seven Seals on
   the Book, has the…These Seven Seals has the Book sealed. See? The Book is absolutely sealed.
   Do you see it? [Congregation says, “Amen.”—Ed.] The Book is absolutely a sealed Book until
   the Seven Seals is broken. It is sealed up with Seven Seals. Now, that’s a different from the Seven
   Thunders. See? This is Seven Seals on the Book. AND THE BOOK WILL NOT, THE SEALS
   WILL NOT BE RELEASED UNTIL THE MESSAGE OF THE SEVENTH ANGEL. See? So
   we—we are presuming; but the genuine revelation of God will be made perfect in that sounding,
   vindicated Truth. NOW, THAT’S EXACTLY WHAT THE WORD SAYS, “THE MYSTERY
   SHOULD BE FINISHED AT THAT TIME.” 50 And this Seven-Seal Book, remember, It was
   closed here, in Revelation the 5th chapter, and in Revelation the 10th chapter It is opened. 51
   And now we’re going to see what the Book says about how It become open. AND IS NOT
   MADE KNOWN UNTIL THE LAMB TAKES THE BOOK, AND BREAKS THE SEALS,
   AND OPENS THE BOOK. SEE? THE LAMB HAS GOT TO TAKE THE BOOK.

   So, Brother Branham must have known that in the mysteries of those Seven Unknown
   Thunders would be the final vindication of Malachi 4. And I’d like to say this, that by the
   inspiration of the Holy ghost before the seals we’re ever opened, I preached a message by the
   Holy Ghost on the final vindication of Malachi 4. And now not knowing, just saying what God

   We are living under our God given privileges that God has redeemed us to. 19 In our picture

   I’m going to take it in a little different angle. IT REALLY REPRESENTED THE COMING OF
   CHRIST THE SECOND TIME on the appearing of Moses and Elijah AND THEN CHRIST
   ONLY. But it represents something more. And every time you read the Word of God, men who
   read this same chapter two thousand years ago was inspired by it. Men who read it five hundred
   years ago was inspired by it, just as inspiring as it is to us tonight because it is the Word of God.
   If I’d write you a letter it might inspire you. But it wouldn’t never help the rest of the world. And
   after while the inspiration would leave the letter as you’d go on. But God’s Word is eternally or
   from everlasting when it comes to Everlasting. That’s the reason I believe the Word. So now,

   yet as been fulfilled, but it must be fulfilled, for it is a germitized word of God spoken through
   malachi the prophet. Jesus referred to it. It is to be just before the coming of christ, the second
   time. (Listen close now.) All Scripture that has not been fulfilled, must be, before that time. The
   Bible is to be finished, to—to be finished. The Gentile dispensation is to be finished, with the
   church age, when this anointed messenger arrives. Of course, he will plant the Seed of the

   Oh, think, people could go right on preaching, thinking they’re getting saved, believing they’re

    Now I’m just gonna keep coming back over these things, now I got a lot of scriptures. I
   hope I don’t wear you out, but I want you to see it.
   Let’s look over in Exodus 19 and I’ll try to go as fast as I can. “And the Lord said unto
   Moses” Exodus 19:9. “I come unto thee in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak
   with thee, and believe thee for ever.” See! “And Moses told the words of the people unto the
   Lord.”
   Exodus 19:9-Reference quote in Reading.
   9 And the Lord said unto Moses, Lo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud, that the people may hear
   when I speak with thee, and believe thee for ever. And Moses told the words of the people unto
   the Lord.
   Exodus 19:13-16-Reference quote in Reading
   13 There shall not an hand touch it, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot through; whether it be
   beast or man, it shall not live: when the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount.
   14 And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and sanctified the people; and they
   washed their clothes.
   15 And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day: come not at your wives.
   16 And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightnings,
   and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the
   people that was in the camp trembled.
   21
   Now the thirteenth verse
   “There shall not an hand touch” This mountain, see!” but he shall surely be stoned, or
   shot through; whether it be beast or man, it shall not live: when the trumpet soundeth long, they
   shall come up to the” Mountain.
   And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and sanctified the people; and
   they washed their clothes.
   And he said unto the people, be ready against the third day: come not at your wives”
   And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, Now the third day! that there were
   thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet” The
   Voice of the Trumpet! “exceeding loud; so that all the people that was in the camp trembled.”
   Now, turn over one more chapter to Exodus 20th verse and the 18th verse.
   Exodus 20:18-22-Reference reading:
   18 And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the noise of the trumpet, and
   the mountain smoking: and when the people saw it, they removed, and stood afar off.
   19 And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear: but let not God speak with
   us, lest we die.
   20 And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is come to prove you, and that his fear
   may be before your faces, that ye sin not.
   21 And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where God was.
   22 And the Lord said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto the children of Israel, Ye have seen
   that I have talked with you from heaven.
   “
   And all the people saw the thundering and the lightnings, and the noise of the trumpet,
   and the mountain smoking: and when the people saw it, they removed, and stood afar off.
   And they said unto Moses, speak thou with us, and we will hear: but let not God speak

   And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is come to prove you, and that his

   And the Lord” spoke “unto Moses, thus thou shalt say unto the children of Israel, Ye
   have seen that I have talked with you from heaven.”
   Amen! All right! Now just look at that!
   Here is God speaking from a mountain, by his Voice, and what does it do? Moses said,
   that He wants to put fear before your faces that you may obey His words. And that is what’s in
   the Seventh Seal, there is lacking among the Bride now, there is no fear of God. They are not
   sanctified, they are not prepared to meet Christ. Evil thoughts among us, jealousy, strife, envy
   and hatred. God said He would judge His people. Amen! Judgement begins at the House of God!
   So, here, the Voice of the Trumpet, and the Bible said, He shall descend from heaven with a
   shout with the Voice of the trumpet. Amen!

   102 Don’t forget that word “Eastward”! Where’s Jesus coming from? The east, in a cloud of
   Glory. Where does the s-u-n rise? East. Where will the S-o-n rise? East. Where was the mercy
   seat sitting? Towards the east. Why have I got you all sitting this way towards the east? Why?
   The altar is to the east. We’ll see it after while, how beautifully, I’m going to draw it out. I asked
   as many as I could to bring papers and so forth, to get these maps in a few minutes. All right:
   …sprinkle it…eastward; and before the mercy seat shall he sprinkle…the blood with his finger
   seven times. 103 Oh, isn’t that beautiful? “Seven times towards the east.” What is it? The
   Seven Church Ages shall be covered by the Blood. Hallelujah! Jesus Christ’s Blood just as
   sufficient in it, yesterday, today, and forever, and to every age, to save every sinner, heal every
   sick person, bring every miracle, every sign to pass. “Seven times,” way back yonder in the Old
   Testament, fourteen hundred and ninety years before Christ come. Think of it! Symbol, “seven
   times shall…” Then shall he kill the goat…the sin-offering, that is for the people, and bring his
   blood with the…in the vail, to do with that blood as he did with the blood of the
   bullock,…sprinkle it upon the mercy seat, and before the mercy seat: And he shall make an
   atonement for the holy place, because…the…of the uncleanness of the children of Israel, and
   because of their trespasses in all their sins: and so shall he do for the tabernacle of the
   congregation, that remaineth among them that is in the midst of—of their uncleanness. 104
   What was it? “The mercy seat.” Where are they now? And there inside of the ark was the what?
   The law. And the law, to trespass one commandment was to die without mercy. But being that
   you could have mercy, the blood had to lay on the altar. They sprinkle the mercy seat. And the
   mercy seat is the altar where you kneel and ask for mercy. God forbid that we ever take it from
   our churches, the old-fashioned altar where men can kneel and call on God for mercy. And
   mercy is rich, and flowing free from the Blood of the Lord Jesus. Now, also, that’s the mercy.
   That’s mercy seat. 105 But you notice in here, it was not mercy seat, for there was “lightnings
   and thunder and voices.” There’s no lightning and thunders at mercy. That’s judgment. 106
   Let’s turn to Exodus, 19 chapter of Exodus and the 16th verse. Exodus, 19 chapter of Exodus,
   and let’s begin with the 16th verse: And it came to pass… Listen what…when God ascended
   upon Mount Sinai: And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were
   thunders…lightning, and a thick cloud upon the mountain, and the voice of a trumpet
   exceedingly loud; (What is the voice of the trumpet? Is the archangel.) so that all the
   people…(Listen!)…all the people…was in the camp trembled. 107 “Judgment!” Whew! They
   had marched out there and God had given them grace to travel by, but they had demanded a law.
   They…God wanted them to be interdenomination; they wanted to make a denomination out of it,
   something they could argue about, instead of just following God and living under His
   jurisdiction, under His power. GRACE HAD PROVIDED A PROPHET, GRACE HAD
   PROVIDED AN ATONEMENT (A LAMB), GRACE HAD PROVIDED ALL THESE
   THINGS, and yet they wanted judgment. They wanted something they could do. 108 God said,
   “Assemble them together, I’ll let them know what it is. I’ll show them what it is.” Read! Listen!
   And the voice of the trumpet got louder and louder until it shook the earth. You see what
   judgment is. I don’t want that. Give me mercy!
   23
   A Voice, A trumpet is a Voice! All right! And it said here in Exodus, we have a type of
   it, that it would produce faith! It said that when they hear Me speak from heaven that they won’t
   believe Me forever, didn’t it! When they saw the Thunders and when the Bride sees the Seven
   Unknown Thunders, as Brother Branham said, that it is not time for the Thunders to be revealed,
   but when they are revealed to the public, it will produce faith in the Bride, and prepare them for
   the rapture.

   62-1230E - Is This The Sign Of The End, Sir?
   William Marrion Branham
   359 And then, if this is the continuation, for the sounding of these last trumpets, or these last
   Seven Thunders that’s coming forth, the mysteries, the last Seals, It’ll have to compete, or
   compare, with the rest the Scripture. And if them first Ones in there opened with a blast of
   thunder, the second Ones will, too, that’s on the backside. Watch what happens. If the vision was
   Scripture, then it must be interpreted by the Scripture, or a continuation of the same Scripture.
   360 Notice, Revelation, 3 and 4, “Seven Thunders.” Seven Thunders, and then notice, 3 and 4,
   and then (what?) an oath from that mighty Angel, that, “Time was finished.” When these
   Thunders, you see, brought forth their voices, then the Angel… 361 Just think of it! “An
   Angel, clothed in a cloud, and a rainbow covenant over His head.” Why, you know Who that
   is. “Put one foot on the land, and on the sea, and lift up His hand and swore, that, ‘When
   them Seven Thunders uttered their voices,’ that, ‘time would be no more.’” 362 And if the
   ministry of the mysteries of God is finished, what if that is them seven mysteries coming forth?
   And a humble, little church like ours, that the Almighty has come and regarded the low estate of
   His people! You say, “What? I don’t think so.” It might not be. But what if it is? Then time has
   run out. Did you think it? Be serious. It may be later than we think. 363 These stars falling into
   their constellation back yonder! THAT ANGEL COMING, AND SAID, “AS JOHN WAS
   SENT TO WIND UP THE OLD TESTAMENT AND TO BRING FORTH THE
   INTRODUCTION OF CHRIST, A MESSAGE WILL WIND UP THE LOOSE ENDS AND
   WILL INTRODUCE THE MESSIAH JUST BEFORE HIS COMING, THE MESSAGE OF
   THE LAST DAYS.” 364 Notice, the mighty Angel swore, with an oath, that, “Time would be no
   more.” 365 Now, I don’t want to keep you too long. Just think of this, a minute now. 366 Now
   listen. This Angel come down from Heaven. See? The other, seven angels of the seven churches,
   was earthly messengers. But this Angel…All the Message is finished; the seventh angel winds up
   the whole thing. And this Angel comes not to the earth; He isn’t a man from the earth, as the
   messengers to the church ages; that’s finished. But, this Angel brings the next announcement.
   And an angel means a “messenger.” And He comes down from Heaven, clothed in that Pillar
   of Light, Cloud, with a rainbow over His head. AND A RAINBOW IS A COVENANT. IT
   WAS CHRIST, “WITH ONE FOOT ON LAND, AND ONE ON THE SEA, AND SWORE,
   THAT, ‘TIME WILL BE NO MORE.’” Where are we at, sirs? What’s all this about? I’m
   asking you. 367 The other angels was messengers, men of the earth. But this Angel…These, that
   said, “To the angel of the church of Laodicea,” “To the angel of the church of Ephesus,”
   messengers of the earth; see, men, messengers, prophets, and so forth, to the church. 368 But,
   this One didn’t come from the earth. He come down from Heaven, because the mystery is all
   finished. And when the mystery is finished, the Angel said, “Time shall be no more,” and
   24
   SEVEN THUNDERS THROWED THEIR VOICES OUT. 369 WHAT IF IT IS
   SOMETHING TO LET US KNOW HOW TO ENTER INTO THE RAPTURING FAITH? IS
   IT? WILL WE RUN, LEAP OVER WALLS? AND IS THERE SOMETHING FIXING TO
   HAPPEN, AND THESE OLD, MARRED, VILE BODIES ARE GOING TO BE CHANGED?
   Can I live to see it, O Lord? Is it so close that I’ll see it? Is this the generation? Sirs, my
   brethren, what time is it? Where are we at? 370 Let’s look at the watch, the calendar, to see
   what date we’re living in. Israel is in Palestine, in her homeland. The ensign, the six-point star of
   David (two thousand years ago, yeah, nearly twenty-five hundred years ago), the oldest flag, is
   flying. Israel is back in her homeland. “When the fig tree put forth its buds, this generation shall
   not die, shall not pass out, pass away, until all things are fulfilled.”

   65-1126 - Works Is Faith Expressed
   William Marrion Branham
   02 Now, a gift, just like I said last night, “A gift is wonderful, but you can’t base your Eternal
   destination on gifts.” You cannot major on a minor, and a—a gift is a minor. And Satan can
   impersonate any gift God’s got, he can make something just exactly like it, see, exactly.
   Therefore, we got to watch that. 103 Like sometimes I express about shouting; I’ve seen demons
   shout. Um-hum. Speak in tongues, I’ve seen demons speak in tongues. Sure, he impersonates It.
   It isn’t a genuine, but it impersonates It, you see, makes it look like it’s real. And people
   sometime, who don’t know the difference, declare this to be “real” when it isn’t real. 104 And
   the same thing they do about Divine healing. They think, “Well, it’s a hocus-pocus, or something
   like that.” It isn’t. It’s a genuine, unadulterated faith in what God said to be the Truth. And that
   anchors! And when it anchors, there’s nothing going to move it. It’s going to stay there. And
   therefore, cutting these corners,… 105 Now, faith is “a revelation from God.” Now, faith is a
   revelation. There’s where I want to stay, there, just a moment. It’s a revelation. He has
   revealed it to you by His grace. It’s nothing you did. You didn’t work yourself up into faith.
   You ever have faith, it’s give to you by the grace of God. And God reveals it to you, therefore
   faith is a revelation. And the whole Church of God is built upon the revelation.
    So, we see that the Voice from heaven prepares the children of Israel to believe God
   forever! Amen! Israel has fear in their hearts! They said, Oh, my, don’t let God speak. Moses,
   you speak to us! Do you see it? All right!
   Now! This is what’s lacking among the Bride: we have no fear of God, we’re not set in
   divine order, but God has saved us a ministry from the time of Genesis - it was always spoke in
   silence. God has saved us a ministry for, to help us to be prepared to meet Jesus Christ.

   221 All right, seems, every time, everything we hear of, “they had forty decisions,” “forty-four
   decisions,” “we had three hundred decisions.” Well, that’s confession. Confessions is “stones.”
   That’s right, ’cause Peter, upon his confession, was called “stone, little rock.” Peter, his
   25
   confession. Now, stones is all right, but what good or what value is a stone to a building if
   there isn’t a true stone mason there with a sharp tool of the Word to cut them and make them
   sons of God? See? What good is a confession? 222 That’s the reason you come back and can’t
   find thirty out of thirty thousand. You just roll the stones out of the dust, and roll them out there,
   and they’re not fit for the temple yet. They’ve got to be cut, measured up to the Word of God,
   placed in there, joined together, built upon the foundation of the apostles’ Doctrine, Jesus
   Christ the Cornerstone. And He said, “He that believeth in Me, the works that I do shall he do
   also.” That’s right. 223 How can we be the Church when we despise one another? He said,
   “This will all man know you’re My disciples, when you have love one for the other.” When we
   proselyte and break up, and for denominational difference…I don’t lay it onto the people, I lay it
   onto the denomination. That’s right. Not the people at all. See? Oh, it’s so bad, yet I… 224 You
   have to have this sharp tool, the Word of God, to shape them into the sons of the Building. Oh,
   my! My prayer is, “God, hurry up with Malachi 4. Give us the Message in the last days. Give
   us someone, send something to save this Pentecostal church.” 225 What kind of a messenger
   would God send us for this last days? I’ll tell you this, my brother, sister, as your brother and
   fellow servant looking for that time to come, he would be the same kind of a messenger that
   come to the other time. The same kind! He would bring the church back to the Word. God, let
   us lay a foundation for it before it gets here. Before he comes, let us put a foundation out and
   be stones, cut, ready to stand shoulder to shoulder with him when God sends him, because He
   promised He’d do it. 226 Now, I know, I feel that coming back. And, remember, with a little gift I
   can catch discernment of spirit, see. Now, you’re resenting that, when I said Malachi 4. But let
   me tell you something. You said, “Jesus said, ‘If you can receive it, this is the Elijah that was
   spoke of.’” 227 But if you see what He said in—in—in Saint Matthew, the 11th chapter and the
   6th verse, “If you can receive it, this is he who was spoke, and said, ‘I send My messenger
   before My face.’” That was Malachi 3, not Malachi 4. 228 For, in Malachi 4, He said, “Before
   this day come, the earth would be burned and the people would walk out upon it; be burnt like
   a stubble.” That’s right. He was talking then of the messenger before His face, which was an
   Elijah, that says… 229 I—I don’t believe in all this here stuff going around today about Elijah’s
   robe and all that stuff. I…All them phonies has to come, of course, to upset the real thing when it
   does come. But, let me tell you, there will rise a messenger at the end of this Pentecostal age
   and wind up the thing. It will be a man. Not a group, not a denomination; but a man. It’s
   always been, and God cannot change His program, He’s the Eternal God. 230 Remember, if
   that messenger (John) was the messenger of Malachi 4, then the Scriptures failed, for It said, “It
   would…the earth would be burnt as a stubble, and the righteous would walk out upon the ashes
   of the wicked.” So read It, and see if that isn’t right. See? But Jesus never said that, He referred
   to Malachi 3, “I’ll send My messenger before My face, to prepare the way for Me.” That’s
   exactly right. 231 Now, but remember, this other one was to restore the faith of the children
   back to the fathers, restore the faith of the children back to the Faith of the fathers, the
   original Bible. 232 That’s exactly what Moses done. That’s exactly what Jesus done. That’s
   what exactly every messenger done down through the Bible, at the end time of that
   dispensation, they restored back the message. The people, through organizations and things, got
   all scrupled up and everything, in them days. 233 They’ve done the same thing today! So we’re
   looking for a messenger. (God, send him!) Do you think we’ll receive him? No, sir! He’ll be
   “a crank and a fanatic,” sure enough, but God will prove him. The real believer, them
   predestinated to Eternal Life, Jesus said, “All the Father has given Me will come, and no man
   26
   can come unless My Father draws him. And all the Father hath” (past time) “given Me,
   they’ll come.” That’s right, they were… 234 I don’t believe in this here Baptist teaching of—of
   Eternal security. I believe it in a way, but I believe you’re secure as long as you’re in the
   Church. But you get out of the…out from under the Blood of Jesus Christ, you’re not secure.
   I’m secure from the rain as long as I’m in here. 235 And when you are baptized into the Holy
   Ghost and say you got the Holy Ghost, and then deny God’s Word? Say you believed and
   received the Holy Ghost, and then deny that the Word is true? Then how can that be the Holy
   Ghost when He was the One that wrote the Bible? The Holy Ghost deny His Own Word, say,
   “I—I was wrong, you are right”? No, that ain’t God. No, sir. 236 Sharp Sword! (Lord, send us
   a great Message.) That’s what we’re looking for. Then, of course, when he comes to fix those
   stones and to cut them out for the building, what will happen? Many of them won’t stand the
   Word test. They’ll love their organization better than they love the Word of God, although that
   Word be vindicated by that man. He’ll be a prophet that’ll come in the Name of the Lord, and
   he’ll be the one that’ll come upon the earth. I believe it. Oh, everybody says, “It’ll be a group
   of people.” 237 I want somebody to show me in the Bible where it’ll be a group of people; God
   would break His Own Word, He can’t do that. No, sir. He promised this. It’ll be a one man.
   And then there’ll be others with him, of course, thousands, the whole Church believers will be
   with him, everywhere. 238 Like it was in the days of Noah, there won’t be too many of them
   saved, because Jesus said, “As it was in the days of Noah.” Do you know that? “As it was in
   the days of Lot,” (count them) “so shall it be.” 239 “Heavens and earth will pass away, but My
   Word will not.” See what I mean? Oh, brother, we better take inventory, it might be really later
   than we think. Might be we’d wake up someday and see that we’ve missed something. Be
   careful! Watch, pray, search, seek, don’t let It pass over you. And, remember, when God’s
   Word is preached, God’s obligated to that Word and will vindicate It. 240 Know what He said
   there, what happened in the days of Lot? He said, “As it was in the days of Lot.” What happened
   there just before the fire fell? What would happen again just before the fire falls, what kind of a
   message the Church would get? Not Sodom now, the elect Church. Just keep them threes: there’s
   the Sodomites; and there was Lot and his group, the formal church; there was Abraham, the
   Elected. All three of them got a message, yes, by different messengers. Watch what kind went to
   the elected Church, what He did to Abraham. Jesus said, “So shall it be at the coming of the
   Son of man.” Now, we can’t deny that, that’s exactly what Jesus said. So, of course it’ll be that
   way. 241 Now, many…when Jesus come and brought the test and said, “Search the
   Scriptures, for in them you think you have Eternal Life, and they are they that testify of Me,”
   could they stand the test? No. And anyone knows, all confessions of rocks that can’t stand the
   Word test is throwed into the heap. It’s cracked, water broke, it won’t stand the test. Oh, man,
   then be sent to the scrap heap! God has always counted character instead of numbers.
   Now that’s why we have the Shout message of Malachi 4, is to preach the Word to
   sanctify the people, to get ready to hear the Voice of the Archangel, Christ himself, descending
   down upon the mountain in the capstone ministry. Hallelujah! Glory to God! Oh, I’m so glad I’m
   upon that mountain. I’m so glad that I’m living upon the top of the mountain. You know God
   never spoke on the bottom of the mountain, He never spoke on the bottom of the mountain with
   the Voice of the Archangel. It was on top of the mountain that He spoke to His people! Let that
   soak in a minute.

   Then in the latter rain will come a Mount Carmel showdown. Watch this carefully now to see it
   in the Word. John was the forerunner of Malachi 3. He planted the former rain and was
   rejected by the organizations of his day. JESUS CAME AND HAD A MOUNT

   rain. Jesus will be the showdown between the denominations and creeds, for HE WILL

   61-1112 - A True Sign That's Overlooked
   William Marrion Branham
   168 “There was a man sent from God whose name was John,” a prophet-sign. Before Jesus ever
   come to the earth, to declare Himself, He sent a prophet before Him. Did He do it?
   [Congregation says, “Amen.”—Ed.] He sent a prophet, the Elijah of the Old Testament, was
   prophesied to come in the power of Elijah of the Old Testament. He was to be a prophet-sign
   that Jesus was coming, that there was to be a Messiah coming. 169 And John came out of the
   wilderness, he was a sign that the Messiah was on His road. When John appeared, Israel ought
   to have knowed, by their prophets. That’s where the people miss it. They don’t believe their
   prophets. They don’t believe. “We don’t believe what Peter said was all right, on the Day of
   Pentecost.” They don’t believe that’s right. They don’t believe what Paul said, the same thing
   Peter did. Said, “If an Angel from Heaven preaching any other word, let him be a accursed.”
   They don’t believe that. See? They don’t believe it. And they didn’t believe their prophets. If
   they’d have knowed, they’d know that Isaiah said, “There’ll be a voice of one crying in the
   wilderness, that’ll prepare the way before the Lord.” They should have knowed it. He was a
   prophet, a prince of the prophets. He told them, but they didn’t believe it. No, no. He said,
   “There’s a Messiah coming.” 170 This man was a man sent from God. Oh, brethren! He had no
   following. God give him a following, a little flock, just like He did Elijah. God give him his
   following. He didn’t get it from some political organization. He preached the Word, stayed on
   God’s Word, and God give him a little flock. Elijah stayed on God’s Word. God give him a little
   flock. 171 This man had no cooperation. He had no following, no cooperation, belonged to no
   denomination, asked for nothing and feared nothing. That was John. Why? He was a man sent
   from God. That’s the reason he stood. He was the Elijah standing there, to prove to the people
   that the Messiah was coming. He said, “I’m the voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, as
   say the prophet Isaiah. Prepare to meet the Lord.”
    Now, I want to show you something. It just quickened to me just then, I just missed that.
   But now you notice, that when the Voice spoke on the top of the mountain, God gave a warning,
   that when the Voice of the Archangel comes upon the top of the pyramid in the last days, He
   warned Moses and said for him to let no one touch that mountain that’s unclean, because God
   28
   will strike them dead. Now, that’s why the prophet said, in Tuscan, Arizona on the tape
   Communion, that Christ is getting ready to appear and Ananias and Sapphira will take place
   again.
   Don’t you see how this lines up with the Word of God? He shall descend from heaven
   with the Voice of Thundering! And when He strikes Ananias and Sapphira dead brother, there
   will come fear back into the church of the living God! Oh Hallelujah! Are you getting it?

   253 Jesus did the works of His Father because the Father was in Him. That is why the works was
   done, because that the Father was in the Son. Do you believe that? [Congregation says,
   “Amen.”—Ed.] That, in Him, He was the incarnate God. Do you believe that? [“Amen.”] That,
   God the Father, which is the Father of Jesus Christ, the Great Spirit dwelt (in the fulness of His
   Power) in Jesus Christ, which was the Tabernacle of God, made flesh and dwelt on earth,
   representing the Word. Jesus was the Word. The Bible said so, Saint John, 1st chapter. And the
   Word was invisible. Now listen close. The Word was invisible until It was made flesh, and then
   the Word become visible. 254 And through His sacrificial death at Calvary, and His
   resurrection, positionally placed His Church in that realm, that the same invisible God could
   come into the individual and make the Word visible. Oh, my! I—I wish my church could get
   that. If you could see, friends, the invisible God made visible! Now listen. Let’s study it again
   now. 255 I’ve often wanted to come into a church, I’ve longed to see it, I guess, where I could
   walk in the back door, front door, wherever it was, look across an audience and see a perfect
   church, all in order. Sin couldn’t stay there; no, the Spirit call it out, you see. It just couldn’t
   stay. Like Ananias and Sapphira, you—you just couldn’t do it. There’ll be no sin in that—that
   group. No, sir. See, the Spirit quickly speak it like that. [Brother Branham quickly snaps his
   finger four times—Ed.] No matter what it was, how little, it would be done. See women and men
   sitting there under the Power of the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of God moving perfectly, moving
   this. Someone had done something wrong in the congregation, couldn’t, they’d be…They
   couldn’t, it’d…They come quickly, confess it before them. The Spirit got a hold of it, to
   confess it, both. They come, tell it, ’cause they know right then it’s going to be called. That’s
   right. That’s the Church of the living God. How my old, poor old heart, now it’s getting old,
   how I’ve longed to stand and see a church like that. I may, yet. I hope to. Perfect works of God,
   without sin, now, it could understand.

    Then it’ll be said, “I’m not joining themselves to that group. They got a living God! They

   (and they were all with one accord in Solomon's porch.
   13 And of the rest durst no man join himself to them: but the people magnified them.
   Now this Voice of God produced fear in the hearts of the people. Alright! Now let’s
   look at this!
    The Bride now is getting ready for God to use them in the last great thing of the Seventh
   Seal, you see! It gets greater all the time, until finally the rapture takes place. After God strikes
   fear into the hearts of the people, by the Voices of the Seven Unknown Thunders, that’s one
   thing it’ll do. It’ll be an out-pouring of the Holy Ghost. AND WHEN THE HOLY GHOST IS
   POURED OUT, BROTHER AND GOD INCARNATES HIMSELF IN HIS PEOPLE,
   THEY’LL BE THE VOICE OF GOD! AND WHEN YOU GOT A GOD INCARNATED IN A

   precept upon precept, here a little bit, and there a little bit. Do you Love it? Oh, Halleluiah!
   Isaiah 28:10-Reference quote:
   10 For precept must be upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here
   a little, and there a little:
   Listen!
   Hebrews 12:25-Reading
   “See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For if they escaped not who refused him that
   spake on earth.”
   Amen! The prophet of Malachi 4, come on now! …
   “... much more shall not we escape, if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven:
   Whose voice then shook the earth…”
   …speaking back there with Moses? Come on now! But now He has promised, “Yet once
   more He will shake not the earth only, but also heaven.
   “And this word, Yet once more, signifies the removing of those things that are shaken”
   Glory to God! “as of things that are made, that those things which cannot be shaken may
   remain.”
   Brother, I want to tell you something, God said, yet once more His Voice would speak
   from heaven and then it would shake the heavens and the earth. And the prophet said, that there
   was gonna be a message come forth that would shake the earth. Can you say, Amen?

   56-0405 - The Resurrection Of Jesus
   William Marrion Branham
   
   25 If the great ecclesiastics of this day will not accept it, God’s able of these stones to rise
   children unto Abraham. God will take the poor, ignorant, and illiterate. But the Scripture must
   be fulfilled. It’s got to be fulfilled. And He promised He’d shake again, not only the heavens,
   not only the earth, but the heavens also. And we’re living in the day to see it done. Jesus said,
   “These works that I do, you’ll do also.” The Scripture must be fulfilled. He promised in the last
   days, that—that He’d sent forth prophets, He would send forth His Spirit, He would send forth
   all these things in the last day. The Scripture’s got to be fulfilled. 26 Now, we have a great
   ministry out, the ministry of the forerunning of the coming of this ministry that’s coming on
   now. John the Baptist went forth preaching repentance. And he really preached it. He shook
   the political world of that day. John did. He went forth. He was anointed with the spirit of Elijah.
   And he went forth and preached. He didn’t do any miracles at all. He never said anything
   against them. But he went preaching. And he brought the whole nominal world, he shook them,
   because all the regions around about come out to hear him. And immediately after his
   ministry got on his go real good, there come the ministry of the Lord Jesus in performing
   miracles, both of it’s in the world today. Amen. And the great climax is at hand. The great
   warfare between the devil and God is going on, and the scene is being set for the final front
   lines where the—the clash will come; and God will reign and rule, for the Lamb was with
   them, overcome them. For He’s Lord of lord and King of kings, and He will ride down every
   opposition. Amen.

   O God, shake not only the earth but the heavens again. Lord, let us go into the fields yonder
   where the millions are waiting, Lord, and hungering, and thirsting, and crying, and begging,
   and heathens are dying in darkness. O God shake this great adulterated nation of America,
   who's fell in folly and a modern Sodom and Gomorrah. "Oh, thou son of the morning, how
   come that you fell. You did run well. What happened to you?" But, "Oh, Jerusalem, Jerusalem
   how oft would He have hovered you." 167 And so is it with America today, as the Holy Ghost
   cries in my heart. "How oft would I made you a flaming torch to the nations and to the world, but
   you accepted Hollywood. You accepted the fashions of the world. And now, you've been given
   over to a Jambres and Jannes and how your—how your day has come. How that mighty men has
   32
   swept the nations. How they have combed through for what they could get. Now, you're pulling
   away and leaving to other nations." O God, she set in the ashes of her own ruin. She set upon her
   own barrel of glamour. And some glorious day the Son of God in His holy righteousness, will
   be revealed from heaven. Then where will we stand? O God, grant today that our hearts be
   established in Thee. Forgive us of our many sins.
   Brother, that He might shake everything that needs to be shaken. Brother, I tell you when
   the ministry of the Seventh Seal moves brother, if you’re not founded upon that rock the Word,
   Christ Jesus brother, it’ll shake everything that can be shaken that’s not on that solid foundation
   on the Word of Christ. Oh, Glory to God. Hallelujah!
   I’m so thankful for that Voice that spoke to Moses. Moses said, “I want to see you Lord,
   I want to know your name. Now you’ve called me Lord to do a work, but I don’t know your
   name. And I have never seen you!” And he said, “Moses there is a place beside me, there is a
   place beside me, stand upon this rock! And there when he stood upon the Rock of the Word, God
   spoke to Moses. He said, there is a cleft in the Rock, there is a cleft in the rock. And He put
   Moses in the cleft of the rock and put his hand over Moses. And there Moses saw God and
   revealed His name to him, Glory to God! And to all that are hid in the cleft of the rock, the
   Word. Glory to God Hallelujah! I can’t stand it hardly!

   60-1208 - The Thyatirean Church Age
   William Marrion Branham
   29 Find out that your name has a bearing on your life. Now, I can’t go too much of that, ’cause
   the devil has a false numerology; we know that; starts people feeling, and so forth like that,
   which runs into spiritualism. And spiritualism is of the devil. We know that. And that’s the way,
   you have to watch. Like they… 30 The reason they called Jesus a “Beelzebub,” a “devil,”
   33
   because, you see, He could discern the thoughts of their mind. See, but He was the Word of God.
   And Hebrews 4 said, “The Word of God, sharper than a two-edged sword, even discerner of the
   thoughts of the intents of the heart, the mind.” See? So, He was the Word, He’s the living Word,
   and the living Word comes into us and then It does the same effect on us. See, same, because It’s
   the same Word. See, It’s the same thing among us. And that’s the way. And sometimes those who
   are not in that bracket speak with tongues, and another one interpret it. What is it? The Word
   made flesh again among us. 31 And then, we notice then that this angel would receive…the angel
   of the church age that received the “stone.” It was a white stone, mean not his own
   righteousness, but “God’s Own righteousness.” 32 And in this stone was “a name,” a name
   that no one knowed but the one who received it himself. He knew it, but no one else could
   know it but him. So when you hear these guy’s flatter you, telling theirs; they’re “John,” they’re
   “Paul,” they’re “Mary,” they’re “this,” “that,” or the “other.” Don’t you believe it, ’cause if it
   was, he’d never say nothing about it. See? That’s right. He has to keep it to hisself. He knowed.
   No one knowed but he himself, but he knowed because every perfect overcomer receives a new
   name in that—that—that way. 33 Did you notice Abraham was called Abram, but when God
   went to use him, He changed his name to “Abraham.” S-a-r-r-a was Sarra, but when God was
   going to use her, He changed her name to S-a-r-r-a-h: Sarah, “princess.” Do you know that
   Jacob…? Jacob was “supplanter.” Esau means “red,” hairy and red; red-headed, and red all
   over, is Esau. Now, and Jacob was “supplanter.” And supplanter is a “deceiver.” Didn’t Esau
   say, “Isn’t his name called Jacob, ‘supplanter’?” But when he wrestled with the Lord all night
   long, and overcome, and was blessed, God changed his name; Jacob to Israel, “a prince with
   God.” Paul was called Saul until he met the Holy Spirit in the form of a Light that shined down
   upon him, his name was changed from Saul to “Paul.” Simon, when he met Jesus, He changed
   his name to “Peter.” That… 34 And when Jesus overcome, His Name was changed. And He
   would reveal that Name, “He that would be with Him, overcome as He has, he received a new
   name; and I’ll reveal My new Name to him.” See? And every overcomer, I mean, among such
   as that: them leaders and so forth. Now, all the children of Israel didn’t get their name changed,
   of course. That’s right. But those high leaders, when they overcome, they had received a new
   name. See how it dovetails in? Just perfectly. 35 And now we find out that he also got “hidden
   manna.” Now, hidden manna is typed to the shewbread. The shewbread was for priests alone.
   That is right. Shewbread was just for the priest. And they…It was a special thing made for the
   priest, that is, the leaders; and this man overcome. The whole congregation got manna, but he
   got a hidden (special) manna, or a “special revelation,” oh, of who Jesus was, and what about
   Him, all about Him. See, he got that revelation if he had overcome, to the angel. “Hold fast,
   for he that…” He had overcome. Addressed to the angel of the church. See? 36 Now we find
   then, tonight, we start out: …to the angel of the church of Thyatira write; These things saith the
   Son of God, who has…eyes like…flames of fire, and his feet…like fine brass; 37 Now, when we
   seen Him in the first, Ephesus Age, or in the first beginning of Revelation, we seen Him in His
   sevenfold glorified personage. “Hair…” We find that John found Him over in the Lord’s day.
   38 When He comes now, He is a Priest. When He was here on earth, He was a Prophet, God’s
   Prophet. Now He took His Own Blood and went before the Father, which makes Him a Priest.
   When He comes back He’ll be a King. Prophet, Priest, and King. He was God’s Prophet, He
   was an Eagle. He was God’s Priest, He was a Lamb. When He comes back, He’ll be the Lion,
   the King, (the tribe of Juda) to reign. 39 But between His Priestly operation, when the
   sanctuary is left, then we find Him standing there. And John said he was in the Spirit on the
   34
   “Lord’s day”; not the seventh day, not Sunday, that’s all mistaken. We found that out, searched
   it through the Scripture, it was the Lord’s day. This is the day of man. The coming of the Lord
   will be His day. 40 And we find him in the Lord’s day. And, when he seen the Lord, He had on
   a “snow-white hair.” And we know that that represents a judge.
    Oh, I ain’t no teacher! See, I said I wasn’t gonna get all stirred up. My, when I see them
   things flying together, dove tailing together, it excites me so much I can hardly stand it.
    All right, we see that when the Voice of God shook the earth over in Hebrews where Paul
   said, it is promised that God is gonna speak one more time and shake the earth. Now that is the
   great shaking that we’re looking for, will come so humble and so simple that many will miss it.
   But. glory to God, all those that are elected to see it and that’s founded upon the rock Christ
   Jesus, that hid in the cleft of the rock by God himself, predestinated in that rock hallelujah, they
   will recognize it. Amen! God will reveal it to them.

   64-0313 - The Voice Of The Sign

   71 What this is for is to get the elected people that’s coming out, like in the days of Noah. Like in
   the days of—of Elijah, the seven thousand or seven hundred, or whatever it was, that hadn’t
   bowed their knee, to call them out. John calling out the elected, and give it over to Christ when
   He come, swapped his church, said, “I must decrease, He must increase, because,” he said,
   “I’m just a voice of Him, crying in the wilderness, ‘prepare the way for the Lord.’” And Jesus
   come the same way. Gets the elected ready to hear the voice of God, that’s what the prophetic
   sign is. Oh, if you follow these Messages, get the per-…get the elected ready. Not the others,
   will never hear it. It’s the elected that’s called.
    All right now, let’s look in Matthew 17:5, I want to put it all in the Word. Now we find
   out that this was Jesus on top of the mountain, after he had been proven of God, after he grew in
   wisdom and tested in all manner of ways, God takes him up on the mountain and there He gives
   him great Authority. Amen! This is the type of the elected Bride of Christ on top of the mountain
   of the pyramid. When God’s Voice will speak from heaven. Amen. Listen now!
   Matthew 17:5-Reading
   5 While he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and behold a voice out of the
   cloud, which said, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him.
   Now, God has brought a prophet to build a Masterpiece for the top of this Pyramid, that it
   might catch the great capstone Jesus Christ. And when we have grown to the place, that God
   comes to the place that He’s going to adopt us, it’ll be on top of this pyramid, where God’s
   Voice is again, Amen! It will speak from heaven and it’ll say, THIS IS MY MASTERPIECE,
   THIS IS MY BRIDE, HERE YE HER! Can you say Amen?

   An Exposition Of The Seven Church Ages - 5 - The Pergamean Church Age
   William Marrion Branham
   Whatever seed started the church will come forth and be like the original seed because it is the
   same seed. In these last days the true Bride Church (Christ’s seed) will come to the Headstone,
   and she will be the super church, a super race, as she nears Him. They in the bride will be so
   much like Him that they will even be in His very image. This is in order to be united with Him.
   They will be one. They will be the very manifestation of the Word of the living God.
   Denominations cannot produce this (wrong seed). They will produce their creeds and their
   dogmas, mixed with the Word. This mongrelizing brings forth a hybrid product. The first son
   (Adam) was the spoken seed-Word of God. He was given a bride to reproduce himself. That is
   why the bride was given to him, to reproduce himself; to produce another son of God. But she
   fell. She fell by hybridization. She caused him to die. The second Son (Jesus), also a spoken
   Seed-Word of God was given a bride like as was Adam. But before He could marry her, she also
   had fallen. She, like Adam’s wife, was put to the test whether she would believe the Word of God
   and live, or doubt the Word and die. She doubted. She left the Word. She died. From a little
   group of the true seed of the Word, God will present Christ with a beloved bride. She is a
   virgin of His Word. She is a virgin because she knows no man-made creeds or dogmas. By and
   through the members of the bride will be fulfilled all that was promised of God to be made
   manifest in the virgin. The word of promise came to the virgin Mary. But that Word of
   promise was He, Himself, to be made manifest. God was made manifest. He, Himself, acted at
   that time and fulfilled His own Word of promise in the virgin. It was an angel that had
   brought her the message. But the angel’s message was the Word of God. Isaiah 9:6. He
   fulfilled at that time all that was written of Him because she accepted His Word to her. The
   members of the virgin bride will love Him, and they will have His potentials, for He is their
   head, and all power belongs to Him. They are subject to Him as the members of our bodies are
   subject to our heads. Notice the harmony of the Father and the Son. Jesus never did anything
   until it was first showed Him by the Father. John 5:19. THIS HARMONY IS NOW TO EXIST
   BETWEEN THE GROOM AND HIS BRIDE. HE SHOWS HER HIS WORD OF LIFE. SHE
   RECEIVES IT. SHE NEVER DOUBTS IT. THEREFORE, NOTHING CAN HARM HER,
   NOT EVEN DEATH. For if the seed be planted, the water will raise it up again. Here is the
   secret of this. THE WORD IS IN THE BRIDE (AS IT WAS IN MARY). THE BRIDE HAS
   THE MIND OF CHRIST FOR SHE KNOWS WHAT HE WANTS DONE WITH THE
   WORD. SHE PERFORMS THE COMMAND OF THE WORD IN HIS NAME FOR SHE
   HAS “THUS SAITH THE LORD.” THEN THE WORD IS QUICKENED BY THE SPIRIT
   AND IT COMES TO PASS. Like a seed that is planted and watered, it comes to full harvest,
   serving its purpose. Those in the bride do only His will. No one can make them do otherwise.
   They have “thus saith the Lord” or they keep still. They know that it has to be God in them
   doing the works, fulfilling His own Word. HE DID NOT COMPLETE ALL HIS WORK
   WHILE IN HIS EARTHLY MINISTRY SO NOW HE WORKS IN AND THROUGH THE
   BRIDE. She knows that, for it was not yet time for Him to do certain things that He must now
   do. BUT HE WILL NOW FULFILL THROUGH THE BRIDE THAT WORK WHICH HE
   LEFT FOR THIS SPECIFIC TIME.
   36
    What a great vindication that was of Jesus’s ministry when God’s own Voice spoke from
   heaven, and said, this is my son hear ye him! Don’t hear them denominations, hear Her, the
   Bride! Can you say Amen? Now this is the masterpiece!
   Matthew 17:5-Reference quote:
   5 While he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and behold a voice out of the
   cloud, which said, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him.

   65-1128M - God's Only Provided Place Of Worship
   William Marrion Branham
   66 Now let us look at some that has been quickened into this house of God, of their age. 267
   Enoch! (In ten minutes we’ll go, if you can just suffer that much longer.) Look, Enoch was the
   living Word of God of his age, he was a prophet. 268 A prophet is God’s reflector. How many
   knows that? The—the reflector doesn’t reflect itself, the—the reflector isn’t the reflection. There
   has to be something strike the reflector—reflector to make it reflect. So a prophet is a chosen
   vessel of God that cannot reflect nothing at all but he’s in direct line with that reflection, God,
   to reflect the image of Christ, the Word. See, nothing else can do it. You are a reflector, that’s
   the reason the prophet had to eat the book. That’s the reason he had to eat the scroll. He had
   to reflect that Word for that age. You got it? 269 Notice Enoch, God’s perfect reflector in type.
   When God was through—through with him, He just translated him, took him up. The mechanics
   that he had reflected become dynamics with the Spirit, and took him up. 270 Same in the days of
   Elijah. Elijah, even to his bones, where that reflection…Reflector of God in his body being
   made manifest the Word of God. They laid a dead man on it, he sparked to life again. We are
   flesh and bone of Him, as long as we are the Bride of Christ. Do you believe that? All right. He
   died for us, and we died to ourselves and are buried in His Name, that we would “no more be of
   the world, but in Him,” of which both the family in Heaven is named after Jesus Christ. That’s
   Ephesians 1:21. For both Heaven…the family in Heaven. What’s the family in Heaven named?
   Jesus. What’s the family on earth named? Well, that’s the house of God where the Blood’s at. Is
   that right? That’s the door, that’s the gate, that’s the place He put His Name, and the Word
   was made flesh and dwelled among us. It’s the Word reflecting and sparking off the age that
   you’re living in. That’s what He was, that’s what Moses was, that’s what Jacob was, that’s what
   the rest of them was, sparking off that Word of God, the reflector that God was reflecting
   Himself. AND COME TO THAT PERFECT IMAGE OF GOD, JESUS CHRIST, GOD’S
   MASTERPIECE; WAS STRUCK THAT HE MIGHT TAKE THE REST OF THEM FOR A
   BRIDE THAT’S BEEN REFLECTORS.
   Why do you think Brother Branham preached, Adoption? Why do you think he preach
   the message, Here Ye Him? Why do you think he preached the message, The Masterpiece? Why
   do you think he preached the, The Masterpiece Revealed”? Why does the people think that the
   prophet preached all these messages for, if God was never gonna do these things? Why your so
   blind you walk around in darkness and its noonday and you don’t know it. Can you say amen?
   37
   He said that He would do nothing unless He revealeth it to the prophet. And if He
   revealed it and God said it, then He must be gonna do something. It’s that simple ain’t it!
   Amos 3:7-Reference quote:
   “Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the
   prophets.”
    All right, over in John 12:28…You know God said He’d destroy everybody that didn’t
   believe this, and cast them into the lake of fire. Why? Because He made it so plain and made it
   so vindicated. He said, “all the fearful - that don’t believe” that they could be in this masterpiece,
   all the unbelievers and the fearful that don’t line up with the Word of God and press their way
   into it, shall find themselves in the lake of fire that burneth with brimstone. Can you say amen?
   And anything that is not of faith, is sin.
   Revelation 21:8-Reference quote:
   8 But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers,
   and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with
   fire and brimstone: which is the second death.

   53 I said, “Brother, every one of them told you truth…?… every one.” That’s right. I said, “I

   tongues. All of those things I believe is the truth. But brother, that’s not what you’re after. See,
   you’re after the accepting of Christ.” The accepting of Christ isn’t raising up your hands, or
   these things, it’s accepting a Person into the heart, and then the attributes comes out. First, get
   things first: Christ in the heart and It’ll bear record. I said, “Like smoking, drinking, gambling,
   committing adultery, those things are not sin.” Then I said that one night and a good old
   Methodist mother raised up. I said, “It’s no sin to drink, not sin to smoke, gamble.” She raised
   up, she said, “Then preacher, would you tell me what sin is?” I said, “Unbelief.” That’s right.
   I said, “The reason you drink, smoke, and carry on like that is because you are an unbeliever.
   That’s the attributes of unbelief causes that. If you are a Christian, you don’t do it. And just
   because you quit drinking, smoking, chewing, and—and committing adultery, that doesn’t
   mean you’re a Christian. You can do that yourself.” That’s right. All right.

   65-0119 - The God Who Is Rich In Mercy
   William Marrion Branham
   30 And I was speaking last Sunday on the Ephesians, how that the Book of Joshua was the
   Ephesians of the Old Testament, and how it was a Book of redemption. 31 And redemption has
   two different parts: “come out of” and “entering into.” First, you have to come out. Some
   people wants to bring the world in with them; but you got to come out of the world, to enter into
   Christ. YOU HAVE TO COME OUT OF UNBELIEF, TO ENTER INTO FAITH. There
   cannot be one thing in your way. To really have genuine faith, you must absolutely leave
   everything that’s contrary to the Word of God, behind, to enter into faith. 32 And that was the
   Book of the Ephesians of the Old Testament, Joshua. Where, Moses represented the law, could
   not save no one; but grace could, and here Joshua is the same word like Jesus, “Jehovahsaviour.” 33 And now then, we find out that we have come to another Ephesians, another
   Ephesus now. Where, that, in our intellectual denominations and so forth, and all of our
   educational programs has come to its—its Jordan, then we must have an—an Ephesians again.
   We must have an exodus, to “come out” and to “go into,” for the Rapture. 34 Now we’re going
   to read tonight from the 2nd chapter of Ephesians. I was just saying that so you could get to
   the—the spot, or turn to the chapter. You, and you hath he quickened, who were dead in
   trespasses and sin: Wherein in times past you walked according to the course of this world,
   according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of
   disobedient: Among whom also we all had our conversations in times past in the lusts of the
   flesh, fulfilling the desire of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of
   wrath, even as others. But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us,
   Even when we were dead in sin, has He quickened us together with Him, or, quickened us
   together with Christ, (by grace are ye saved;) 35 I want to take from there a few, or part of the
   verse, “but God,” The God Who Is Rich In Mercy. 36 I want you to notice here of the prophet,
   apostle, rather, Paul, who—who, how he made mention of this, how, “You has He quickened,
   who were once dead. You hath He quickened, who were once dead, dead in sin and trespasses;
   walking after the things of the world, the desire of the flesh, and fulfilling the desire of the
   mind. Has…” 37 What caused this change, you see? And what caused it, “from one time
   being dead,” to quicken? Quicken means “made alive.” There was a change, from death unto
   Life. There is no other, there is no other thing that could happen to any person, so great, as to
   change him from death to Life. A man, if he was dying, physically, and could be healed
   physically, that would be a great thing, but nothing so great as when he is spiritually dead and
   God has quickened him to Life. 38 “You once, in times past, dead.” You were dead. Even many
   here tonight, one time, can look back and know that you were dead. But now why aren’t you
   dead tonight, as you were then? You deserve to be that way, because you was a sinner, “but
   God Who is rich in mercy.” That’s the—that’s the thing, “God Who was rich.” All these
   things that we were, “but God”! That made the change right there, “God Who is rich in
   mercy”! 39 Oh, I’m so glad for that, that He being rich in mercy. If He was just rich in money,
   if He was just rich in materials, which He is, but yet the greatest thing is being rich in mercy.
   Oh, what a great word that is, how that we were once dead. 40 And we was speaking the other
   night on how the seed must die. And everything around that germ of life must not only die, but
   rot. If it doesn’t rot, it cannot live. And rot is, “completely done away with; it’s finished.” And
   39
   until we get to the place that our own ideas and our own thinking is completely gone and it’s
   rotted away from us, then the germ of life can begin to live. 41 Now—now we might, I might
   inject just a little bit of doctrine here, that I don’t…If you don’t believe it, all right. That’s just
   okay. I do believe it. I believe that—that a man, when he is born in this world, that when you’re a
   little baby, born into the world, you could not have been here without being the foreknowledge of
   God, because He is infinite and He knows all things. And when that little baby is born into the
   world, there is something in that baby. If he is ever going to have Life, there is a little something
   in there, in that child then, that he comes to, sooner or later. That little seed is in him. Now if
   you’ll take…The Scriptures plainly declare that. 42 Now if you’ve got Eternal Life tonight, if
   we have Eternal Life, then we always were, because there is only one form of Eternal Life. We
   always were. And the reason we were, because we are a part of God. And God is the only thing
   that’s Eternal.
   
    And Israel failed to go over and possess the land because of unbelief, and Paul said,
   “take heed how you stand least ye fall.” For God spared not the natural branch Israel, take heed
   that He will not spare you, the wild branch. Can you say amen! Then have faith in God.

   17 And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, wert graffed in
   among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree;
   18 Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee.
   19 Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be graffed in.
   20 Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not
   highminded, but fear:

   you can’t believe It, it just won’t happen. Now, I can’t make you believe, neither can you make

   God’s faith. Your intellectual faith might believe it fine, but unless the faith of God is down in
   your heart…See, your intellectual faith can accept it, do that. And just keep believing it with all
   your heart until God does reveal it to you. See? Just keep believing it until God does reveal it.

   But until He reveals it…
    If God said, He’d reveal something to the prophet, and if He’s gonna do something, He’ll
   reveal it. So then, God is getting ready to do something. So, away with all your unbelief, cast all
   that unbelief away from you and CIRCUMCISE YOUR MIND AND LET IT BE RENEWED

   62-0123 - Forsaking All
   William Marrion Branham
   253 Someone said to me, not long ago, a famous preacher. He said, “Brother Branham.” Called
   me into his room, laid hands on me. Said, “You’re going to ruin your ministry.” I said, “What?”
   254 Said, “You’re always bawling people out, for the way they do.” Said, “Why don’t you…the
   people think you’re a prophet.” I said, “I’m no prophet.” 255 He said, “Well, people think you
   are. Why don’t you teach them spiritual things, how they can receive great spiritual blessings
   and things?” 256 I said, “How can I teach them spiritual things when they don’t even know
   their ABC’s? They won’t even have the common decency to line up with the Word, let alone
   spiritual things. If they don’t believe earthly things, how will they believe heavenly things?”
   He said, “Well, you’ll just ruin your ministry.” 257 I said, “Any ministry that the Word of God
   41
   will ruin, it should be ruined.” Come back to the Word. That’s right. 258 Now, if you’re
   smoking cigarettes, and so forth like that, and claiming you got the Holy Ghost, shame on you.
   You men! You say, “Why you picking on the women?” You men that’ll let your wives do that, oh,
   mister, calling yourself a Christian, shame on you. 259 I know this is rough. But, brother, it’s—
   it’s trimming time. It’s time for the Holy Ghost to come, take His Bride. And if it don’t line
   with His Word, then there is something wrong. 260 You who have fallen away, stay home on
   Wednesday nights and won’t come over here to church, watching televisions, and other nights of
   church! Think, you—you really say, and if you have to come to church, you have to force
   yourself to do it, because you think it’s a law you do it. You ought to do it. It’s honorable to do
   it. And if you don’t love to do it, there is something wrong. There’s a Holy Spirit that makes
   you love to serve God.
    All right! John 12:28. Alright! John 12:23 through 28.
   John 12:23-28-Reading
   23 And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.
   24 Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth
   alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.
   25 He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto
   life eternal.
   26 If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if
   any man serve me, him will my Father honour.
   27 Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this
   cause came I unto this hour.
   28 Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified
   it, and will glorify it again.

   244 All the host of Heaven was silent for this half hour, when this Seventh-Seal mystery in the
   Book of Redemption was broke open. Think of it. But, It’s broke. The Lamb breaks It. You know

   63-0324E - The Seventh Seal
   William Marrion Branham
   391 Now, now, do you notice? On the opening of this Seventh Seal, it’s also in a threefold
   mystery. This one, I have…will speak and have spoke, that it is the mystery of the Seven
   Thunders. The Seven Thunders in Heaven will unfold this mystery. It’ll be right at the Coming
   of Christ, because Christ said no one knew when He would return. 392 Did you notice, when
   the Jews asked Him that? Know… When we compared the Scripture here with Matthew 24, with
   the six Seals, the Seventh Seal was left out. Because, you see, Christ said, “Only God Himself
   knowed; not even the Angels.” No wonder, It wasn’t even written. You see, they hushed;
   nothing take place then. Angels don’t know It. Nobody knows when He is coming. 393 But
   there’ll be a—there’ll be a—a Seven Voices, of these Thunders, that will reveal the great
   revelation at that time. So, I believe, to us who…If we don’t know It, and if we…It won’t be
   knowed till that time. But it will be revealed in that day, in the hour that it’s supposed to be
   revealed in. So, the thing for us to do is to be reverent before God, and serve Him, and do all
   that we know how to do, and live good, Christian lives. Here, now, we find that the Sixth Seal has
   been opened to us; we see It. AND WE KNOW THAT THIS SEVENTH SEAL CANNOT BE
   BROKE TO THE PUBLIC UNTIL THAT HOUR ARRIVE. 394 Now, there was some reason
   that God let this Seven Voices be thundered. Because, It must come, see. For the…WE FIND
   THAT CHRIST, THE LAMB, TOOK THE—THE BOOK IN HIS HAND, AND HE OPENED
   THAT SEVENTH SEAL. But, you see, it’s a hidden mystery. No one knows It. But, It—It,
   right along with what He said, “No one would know His Coming.” They also would not know
   about this Seven-Thunder mystery. So, you see, it’s connected together. 395 That much, we have
   an understanding of It, today, because the rest of It is all unfolded; but this is not unfolded. But
   sitting in my room, and I heard this…or, not heard it, rather, but seen It unfold to this Seven
   Thunders. Now, that’s as far as we can go, right there. 396 And now I trust that each and every
   one of you will serve God and do that which is right. And love Him, all your life, and serve Him.
   And God will take care of the rest. 397 Now, we have, in the completion here now, by the grace
   of God, all the mysteries of the six Seals that’s been sealed up, and we understand and know here
   that the Seventh Seal is not to be known to the public. 398 Now, His Coming, at the hour of His
   Coming, when the destruction of the earth, you know. He said there, “What will be the sign of
   the coming of the end of the world?” In Matthew 24, there where they asked Him that question.
   He went down to that. He told about Israel being gathered as a nation, in the 31st verse, of
   Matthew 24:31. But then He started off on parables, see. Then you see the… “Learn a parable of
   the fig tree. When you see it putting forth its buds, why, you know spring is nigh. And then when
   you see this coming to pass, then know the time is nigh.” See, Israel gathering in its own
   homeland. But, you notice, He omitted the revelation of this Seventh Seal. 399 And here, when
   the Seventh Seal, when He opened It, He also omitted It again, see. So we see that It is a
   complete mystery, therefore the hour is not yet for the mystery to be known. Therefore, we’re
   this far, and the rest of IT WILL BE KNOWN RIGHT AROUND ABOUT THE TIME THAT
   JESUS APPEARS ON EARTH AGAIN, FOR HIS BRIDE, OR WHATEVER TAKES PLACE
   AT THAT TIME. Now, until that time, let’s just all pray, live good, straight, Christian lives,
   looking forward for His Coming. 400 And now if this tape would happen to fall into the hand of
   some persons somewhere, don’t try to make any kind of an ism out of it. The only thing you do,
   43
   you just continue serving God. BECAUSE, THIS GREAT SECRET IS SO GREAT THAT
   GOD WOULDN’T EVEN LET JOHN WRITE It. It thundered out, but He…knowing that,
   promising us that It would be opened. But, to this time, It isn’t opened. 401 And now we are
   grateful to God for what He has showed us. I been sitting in the room up there for eight days.
   And the Message that I have just got through explaining to you, many of you here will
   understand. And I promised that there was something going on, spiritual, all the time, that I was
   sure you were missing it. And here is what it is; IT’S THE ABSOLUTE VINDICATION OF
   THIS INTERPRETATION OF THE SCRIPTURES BEING SENT OF GOD.
   God has predestined a half hour of silence of a ministry for the Masterpiece, the Bride!
   And there He said, I will glorify it one more time.

   489 It goes right by them, and they don’t recognize it till it’s gone. It only picks up the
   predestinated Seed that God predestinated before the foundation of the earth. The same thing
   come through in the days of Noah, same thing come through in the days of Moses, days of
   Elijah, days of the prophets, days of Jesus, on down through and to this very hour. The
   pregnated person with the Seed of God, the Word in there manifesting Itself, so surrendered to
   the will of God that the Word, and the Word alone, manifests Itself in this person, the
   prisoner, to an individual. 490 Not say, “My church…” Now, “my church” has nothing to do
   with it. 491 It’s an individual, one person! All hell is against this Teaching. All hell is against
   this Truth, but it is the Truth. 492 Jesus never said, “Now, Peter, you and John, and all the rest
   the people, YOU’VE GOT THE REVELATION, NOW THE WHOLE CHURCH IS SAVED.”
   No. 493 It was to him, personally. “I say unto thee, thee,” not to them, “to thee, thou art Peter;
   upon this rock I’ll build My Church.” And the word Peter, means “a stone.” Stone means “the
   confessed one,” or, “the separated one.” 494 Upon a certain stone, upon a certain thing; see, a
   called-out, the Church called out; upon this stone, upon this “revelation.” “Flesh and blood
   never revealed it to you. But upon this revelation, called-out group, I’ll build My Church in
   them. And all the gates of hell will never be able to withstand it.” 495 “Not one hair of your
   head shall perish. You are Mine! I’ll raise you up in the last day, give unto him Eternal Life,
   and raise him up at the last days.” There it is, the revelation. Not them; but “him,” an
   individual! Not a group; an individual! All hell is against it. 496 BUT HIS MYSTERY IS
   ONLY REVEALED TO HIS BELOVED BRIDE. THAT’S THE ONLY ONE COULD SEE
   IT.

   He that believeth on Me, as the Scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living

   I—I think I got one. So if you notice on the back of your dollar bill, why have they got the
   pyramid says, “The Great Seal?” You ever notice it on your American dollar? Um-hum. “The
   Great Seal.” Notice on that pyramid also, how it starts at the bottom and keeps coming up like
   this, minority, minority. And did you notice, the capstone’s not even on it. Neither is the pyramid
   capped. Why? The Capstone was rejected, Jesus Christ, the Head of it, exactly right. 117 Now,
   notice, in the Lutheran age, what did we live? Justification, way down here at the bottom,
   planting the foundation stones, Luther; Wesley, we believed in sanctification, to come into the
   minority; Pentecost, still the baptism of the Holy Ghost, up in the minority. But watch, the
   Church that goes right out to the end of it, right out at the end of that, that Church is going to
   have to be so perfectly like the ministry of Jesus Christ, till when that stone comes, it sets right
   smack in the groove. Oh, Hallelujah! Oh. 118 If you can catch it and know what I’m talking
   about, the very ministry that Jesus Christ was doing here on earth, when it comes back, the
   very same ministry He had, Pentecost will not have to widen itself out in organization, but
   shape itself up in Christ until the Headstone and the Church will fit one to the other. And
   them is so cemented, till you can’t even take a razor blade and go around and find the crack
   where they were put together. And that’s how the Church is got to come, so much like Christ.
   And look what we got to do then. Cut away and circumcise and chop off, and form and molded
   into the image of Jesus Christ until that Church and the Cap comes right smack together. 119
   Look at my hand on a shadow on the wall. When it’s away from me, it’s scattered out. As it
   comes, it becomes more closer. There’s not a great big fingers, it’s getting smaller and smaller
   and smaller, getting darker and darker and darker, until the shadow, the negative and the
   positive becomes one. And that’s the way it is in the Coming, the Church has got to shape itself
   46
   till it hasn’t got a spot or wrinkle in it. Amen. There is that second Bible. 120 The third one’s
   wrote on paper because this is that great educational age that we’re living in. And neither will
   none of them contradict one another. So you see, the great solar system speaks of Christ.
   Everything that you see speaks of Christ if you just look at it. Look at the church today in its
   condition, weak, backslidden, gone back into the world. That speaks of Christ, exactly what He
   said. He’d stand at the door and knock. And that, put outside, organized Him out, and set Him
   outside; our creeds and so forth took Him out. But He still stand at the door and knocking and
   said, “Everyone I love, I chasten and rebuke.” That’s right. Trying to cut them down and
   bring them to a spot to where when the great Capstone comes, the ministry that’s in the
   church and the Capstone will just come right straight together like a magnet. They will just
   seal right in together. Oh, God, help us to have… It’ll be there; don’t worry; it’ll be there. He
   said it would be there. So let’s us fit ourselves to meet that Cornerstone. Let us love and project
   our lives in Christ and be sincere and stay with the Word, until when He comes we just fit
   right in like the glove over the hand, like that, with Him. Oh, that’s the Church that God is
   waiting for. Yes, sir.

   48

   Oh, But I believe brother, when the Voice, Thunders sound, God will take those little
   sheep and open up their eyes to that tent ministry brother. He’ll open up their eyes, and then
   brother, there’ll be a great thing take place. Shame on you preachers.
   All right, God said here that He would glorify His name one more time. Now the ministry

   65-0218 - The Seed Is Not Heir With The Shuck
   William Marrion Branham
   Now notice. But at the opening of the Seven Seals, Revelation 10, the full Word is to be
   born into manifestation again, and vindicated by the Spirit of God, in the full strength as It
   was when He was here on earth; manifested in the same way, doing the same things that It
   did when It was here on earth. Amen! Hebrews 13:8, said, “Jesus Christ is the same
   yesterday, today, and forever.” In Saint Luke 17:30, Jesus said, “In the last days, as it was in
   the days of Sodom, when the Son of man will be revealing Himself again, it’ll be the same
   thing.”
   
   Can you say, Amen! That’s why Brother Branham said, the spoken word is the original
   seed. And listen, when the Seals we’re opened, when the Seals we’re opened, the book in the
   right hand of Him that sat upon the throne was opened. Showing you that all the mysteries of
   Word was revealed to the Bride that she might be a spoken Word seed of God. To be revealed as
   a Masterpiece to the World Council of Churches. Why can’t the people see this? What’s the
   matter with the people that they can’t see this? It’s as plain as my hand is in front of me. Glory

   REVEALS THE CHURCH AND RAISING IT UP BY THE SAME WORD. It’s a part of His

   Bridegroom; the Bride being the Body of the Bridegroom, must follow, the Bride, because
   that’s the Head. AND THE HEAD IS REVEALED, AND COME BACK WITH ETERNAL

   63-0116 - The Evening Messenger
   William Marrion Branham
   108 And the people who laughed and made fun and would not accept his message, they perished
   with the rest of the unbelievers. 109 But the believers went out and entered into the promised
   land, they went under the anointed message of the messenger. It was a message of deliverance,
   that God promised He would bring His people to a land flowing with milk and honey. And it
   happened, because God had already said so, and Moses come and was a-vindicated as the
   messenger of that day. Now, that brings it pretty plain to us. 110 All right, then we find out that
   Moses was correctly identified. 111 AND THEN AT THE CHANGE OF THE AGE, THE
   TIME COME FOR…BETWEEN LAW AND GRACE. THERE HAD TO COME A TIME
   THAT THIS SPOKEN MESSIAH WAS TO COME. We find out that the time that the people
   had twisted the law, made it all under a great group of something, and had all kinds of—of
   traditions of man, they had injected into it. AT THE CHANGING OF THE TIME CAME
   JESUS, ANOTHER PROPHET, GOD-PROPHET. Now, you say, “He wasn’t a prophet.” 112
   The Bible said He was. “The Lord your God shall raise up a Prophet likened unto me.” He
   was the God-Prophet, at the changing of time between law and grace, that He had spoke of for
   all these years. After He had give the law to Moses, then at the change of the time, when He
   said it would be done, then He come back to grace. And He sent a Prophet prophesying of the
   time. Now—now, the believers, He gathered them; the unbelievers perished in His day. All who
   believed on Him was saved; all that did not believe His message was lost. 113 That’s exactly
   what took place in the days of Noah; that’s what took place in the days of Lot; that’s what took
   place in the other days, the days of Moses; that’s what taken place in the days of Jesus Christ.
   For they despised the message and perished, and those who believed the message was lost…or
   was saved. 114 Now, now, then comes the church dispensation in. We lived back in Noah’s time,
   the antediluvian; we come into the dispensation of law; then in the dispensation of grace, the
   church. And now the church dispensation is ending. We all know that. 115 Now, if God did
   thus-and-thus in that dispensation, in those other two dispensations, He has to remain the same
   and do the same in this dispensation, ’cause He said He would do it. I’ll prove it in a few
   minutes, by the Word, that He said He would do it. Now, He cannot change His program, He’s
   God. Notice what He did in them dispensations. 116 Now we come to the church dispensation’s
   end time. That’s what I read tonight: …it shall be Light in the evening time. 117 WE’VE HAD
   PLENTY OF DISMAL TIME, BUT THERE SHALL COME LIGHT. THE SAME SON
   THAT CAME AND CHANGED THE DISPENSATION THEN, COMES AGAIN! That’s
   going to be from earth to Glory. We’ll go in that. One time we went in, the other time we went
   out, and this time we’re going up! See? All right: in, out, up. We’re coming to the end time. And
   we’re not only coming, we’ve already arrived. We are at the end time! 118 What does God find
   in this end time? God finds in this end time just exactly what He found in other end times,
   unbelief! He’s always been that, He, when He comes, He—He finds unbelief. He finds that the
   51
   program that He laid down to the people… 119 Back there in Noah’s time, if they would a-lived
   after His ordinances, offered the sacrifices…They got away from it. When He come, He found
   this, that thing operating wrong. 120 The same thing He did when He come on earth, He found
   the people and the Pharisees, and so forth, after the law. What was they doing? Just no sincerity
   in it at all, just go ahead and slop it through any old way, and “Just as long as they joined the
   church, and that’s all they needed.” And that’s what He found. 121 And that’s what He’s
   found again! He finds the same thing, people doesn’t change. So if He sent His program and
   the PEOPLE DISBELIEVED IT THERE AND THEY PERISHED, THEY BELIEVED IT
   AND LIVED, (now, on those two), it’s got to be the same on this time. It’s got to be the same.
   No… 122 IT’S ALWAYS BEEN A FIGHT FOR THE MESSENGER TO SEPARATE THE
   OLD FROM THE NEW. IT’S ALWAYS BEEN THAT FIGHT, FOR—FOR THE
   MESSENGER COMING IN TO SEPARATE OLD FROM NEW, though always the message
   must be Scriptural, now, for each has foretold of the other to come. 123 Now, let’s take, for
   instance, JESUS. HOW HARD IT WAS, HIM TO COME IN AND CHANGE THE
   MESSAGE FROM LAW TO GRACE. Yet the Bible said it would come that way, “There’d
   come a—a Messiah, and the daily sacrifice would be taken away.” And we know it was
   prophesied through the prophets. What a great thing it was for Him to do that. But we find that
   He did it. And the one…He did it because the Scripture said, and the believers of that day (socalled believers) absolutely would not agree with Him.
   
   Raise your hands and praise God! WHERE ARE YOU AT? WHERE ARE YOU
   GOING? WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR? Amen!
   God came down in the evening time and talked to Adam. Glory to God! And the Bible
   said that IN THE EVENING TIME IT SHALL BE LIGHT. AND I WILL SPEAK TO MY
   PEOPLE that are called by My name. Amen. AND I’LL GLORIFY MY NAME ONCE AGAIN.
   And the works that I do, shall they also do and greater works than these shall they do BECAUSE
   I’LL BE IN THEM AND IF I’M IN THEM THEN I’M THE WORD AND THE SPOKEN
   SEED OF GOD, is the Bride of Jesus Christ! Can you say amen!

   An Exposition Of The Seven Church Ages - 9 - The Laodicean Church Age
   William Marrion Branham
   Revelation 3:21, “To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with Me in My throne, even as I
   also overcame, and am set down with My Father in His throne.” Now what are we to
   overcome? That is the normal question to ask here. But that is not the actual thought of this
   verse for it is not so much WHAT we are to overcome but HOW we are to overcome. Now this is
   logical, for does it matter much WHAT we are to overcome as long as we know HOW we can
   overcome? A quick look at those Scriptures which involve the Lord Jesus overcoming will bring
   out the truth of this proposition. In Matthew 4, wherein Jesus is tempted of the devil, He
   overcame the personal temptations of Satan by the Word, and by the Word only. In each of the
   three major trials that corresponded exactly to the temptation of the Garden of Eden, the lust
   of the flesh, the lust of the eye, and the pride of life, Jesus overcame by the Word. Eve fell to
   the personal temptation of Satan by failing to use the Word. Adam fell in direct disobedience to
   the Word. But Jesus overcame by the Word. And right now, let me say that this is the only way
   to be an overcomer, also it is the only way that you can know if you are overcoming, because
   that Word CAN’T fail. Now notice again how Jesus overcame the world systems of religion.
   When He was repeatedly badgered by the theologians of His day, He constantly applied the
   Word. He spake only what the Father gave Him to speak. There was not a time when the world
   was not utterly confused by His wisdom for it was the wisdom of God. In his own personal life,
   contending with Himself, He overcame by obedience to the Word of God. In Hebrews 5:7 it
   53
   says, “Who in the days of His flesh, when He had offered up prayers and supplications with
   strong crying and tears unto Him That was able to save Him from death, and was heard in
   that He feared; though He were a Son, yet learned He obedience by the things which He
   suffered; and being made perfect, He became the author of eternal salvation unto all them
   that obey Him.” What was He obedient to? The Word of God. Now then, there will not be one
   person who will sit in the throne of the Lord Jesus Christ unless he has been living that Word.
   Your prayers, your fastings, your repentances — no matter what you present to God — none of
   that will gain you the privilege of sitting in that throne. It will be granted only to the WORD
   Bride. As the throne of the king is shared with the queen because she is united to him, so only
   they who are of that Word even as He is of that Word will share that throne. Remember we
   have shown clearly all through the ages that even as Adam and Eve fell because they left the
   Word, so the Ephesian Age fell by turning slightly from the Word, until with every age continuing
   to turn away, we have a final repudiation of the Word by the World Church system. This
   Laodicean Age ends in a blackout of the Word, thereby causing a departure of the Lord from
   the midst. HE STANDS OUTSIDE CALLING TO HIS OWN WHO FOLLOW HIM BY
   OBEDIENCE TO THE WORD. AFTER A SHORT AND POWERFUL DEMONSTRATION
   OF THE SPIRIT THIS LITTLE HUNTED AND PERSECUTED GROUP WILL GO TO BE
   WITH JESUS.

   209 Oh, don’t, don’t miss this. Please don’t. I feel It coming from the top of my head. Looky.
   Look. 210 Then, if you are Abraham’s Seed, you can’t dispute with God. Abraham’s Seed is a
   part of this Spirit. For, God gave Abraham a sign of circumcision, cutting off the flesh, for a
   witness He had received him. In this last days, has took the Holy Ghost and circumcised every
   believer, of cutting off all doubts and unbelief, to believe God’s Word is pure and holy, and It’s
   the Truth. Circumcision; cutting away all unbelief, everything, cutting loose every shore line.
   Saying, “God, I believe You; live or die, sink or drown. It’s Your Word. I believe It.” Then, see
   what I mean? 211 And God said, “I’ll swear by Myself, ’cause there’s none I can swear by.”
   He’s the greatest thing there was. He said, “I’ll swear by Myself, that I’ll save Abraham and
   his Seed.” That’s right. 212 Now who is the Seed of Abraham? Those who are filled with the
   Holy Ghost, are Seeds of Abraham. Look. Look. For Abraham come Isaac; through Isaac
   come Christ. How do we get into Christ then? We can only be in Christ…The Bible said, “You
   that are in Christ are dead, and are taking on Abraham’s Seed, and are heirs according to the
   promise.” Is that right? Whew! “Those that are dead in Christ, are Abraham’s Seed, and heirs
   according to the promise. 213 So, through that Blood cell! Through your natural blood cell,
   was broken away, and you are enshrouded with the Blood cell of Abraham’s Seed, which is
   Christ. In that Blood cell, can only contain…Not iniquity, and filth, and nastiness. Inside of
   that Blood cell, can only attain the Life of God, which is the Holy Ghost. 214 And you can no
   more be destroyed than God Himself can be destroyed, for It’s a part of God. “I’ll raise them up
   at the last day.” “Those who He has justified, He hath already glorified.” And in the Presence
   and the mind of Almighty God, every man born again of the Holy Ghost is glorified in His
   Presence now, waiting for the time of redemption. Whew! My, my! You see it? God, through
   54
   grace, has called you to Abraham’s Seed. And every one of Abraham’s Seed, Almighty God
   swore by Himself He would raise him up. God said He would take care of it. 215 How you
   Abraham’s Seed? By being dead, your life hid, “By one Spirit we are all…” Not “lettered” in,
   not “sprinkled” in. “But by one water”? No. “But by one Spirit are we all baptized into this
   Blood cell, which is Christ Jesus. In the original, was only one Blood cell, and we’re baptized
   in There, with Him, and He was the Son of God. [Brother Branham claps his hands together

   whatsoever is not of faith is sin. And God said, “To he that overcometh will sit with me in My
   throne” and “He’ll rule and reign with Me in my throne for a thousand years.” Amen! So, let’s

   53-0729 - Questions And Answers On Genesis
   William Marrion Branham
   264 Now, these had the Holy Ghost; and these were sanctified. These were sanctified plus the
   Holy Ghost, believing all the phenomenons and everything of God’s Power. Everything God
   spoke of Here, they had it, believing it. These were taken up. 265 And these said, “Give us, to
   us, now.” 266 Said, “We just got enough to get in with,” and away they went in the Rapture. 267
   And they said, “Go buy from those who sell to you,” they said. And they went to try to pray
   through then, to receive the Holy Ghost, but the Gentile dispensation had been finished and the
   persecution rose. And He said, “They were cast into outer darkness where there’ll be weeping
   and wailing and gnashing of teeth.” But in the second resurrection they’ll be the sheep that’s
   separated from the goats, but never the Bride, never the Elect. That’s the remnant of the Seed of
   the woman. 268 What is a remnant? The piece that’s cut, left. Same kind of goods. Is that
   right? You go to cut you a dress out of calico, and you spread out a big piece of calico and cut
   it out. It’s your business where you lay the pattern. It’s God’s business where He lays the
   pattern. He cuts her right out. Is that right? And now this, rest of this calico left here, is just as
   good a calico as in the dress. Is that right? But it’s God’s election. God elects His Church, God
   predestinates His Church; God foreordained that, foreordains His Church, and HE TAKES
   THAT CHURCH OUT! And the remnant is left to go through the Tribulation Period.
   And God made up a Bride. Now when a woman begins to make an apron she lays down
   her material. She lays it down on a flat table like kitchen table by the sewing machine. She gets
   the scissors and cuts around the pattern. And God cuts out a pattern just like Jesus Christ, a
   masterpiece, a son of God, and speaks of the World Council of Churches. He cuts that pattern
   out, or she cuts that pattern out, and what’s left there is the remnant of the material. So, he picks
   this up and sews on it by Malachi 4. He begins to sew on it and begins to stitch it in the right way
   and then you got a beautiful garment. Amen! You got it just like the pattern of the original
   doctrine at Pentecost. Hallelujah! The name of Jesus Christ and the power of the Holy Ghost.
   And then Brother God reaches down then and gets the remnant of the material. Now were
   coming to it. All right!
    The Voice of Revelation 18:4, it cries out with the same message that the other angel did.
   Come out of that denomination, come out of them dead churches God’s gonna plague them.
   Revelation 18:4
   4 And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not
   partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.
    Then down here in Revelation 18:22 and it said;
   Revelation 18:22-Reading
   22 “And the voice of harpers, and musicians, and of pipers, and trumpeters, shall be heard no
   more at all in thee;” That’s the apostate church. “and no craftsman, of whatsoever craft he be,
   shall be found any more in thee; and the sound of a millstone…”
   58
    The grinding of the word brother! Amen! Glory to God. When Malachi 4 come, that
   great big grinding stone brother, it grinds up the corn. Brother, he began to grind up the corn and
   he ground it up as fine as fine can be, every grain was ground up the same as Acts 2:38 brother.
   He ground it up just as the early apostles did, and he begin to make bread out of it, and he begin
   to feed the Bride of Jesus Christ and I ate from that bread from heaven that, that great millstone
   ground up for me. Can’t you raise your hands and praise him! Hallelujah! Glory to God!
   Acts 2:38-Reference quote:
   38 Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus
   Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.
    Listen to me now! Glory to God! All the preachers in this hour had all the gospel messed
   up and put it in one denominational pot, and they tried to feed some of that to the children. Oh
   God! And the children cried out, oh man of God there’s death in this old denominational pot.
   And the prophet of Malachi 4 come along and he reach down in…Act 2:38 and Acts 2:4 Glory to
   God and Ephesians 1 and Romans 8. And he took some of that fine ground meal and he throwed
   it into that denominational pot and the soup was healed.
   Acts 2:38-Reference quote:
   Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ
   for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.
   For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as
   the Lord our God shall call.
   Acts 2:4-Reference quote:
   And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the
   house where they were sitting.
   And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them.
   And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit
   gave them utterance.
   Ephesians 1:5- Reference quote:
   5 Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to
   the good pleasure of his will,
   Romans 8:30- Reference quote:
   Moreover, whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also
   justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.
    But they wanted to go on and eat some of that denominational pot. You don’t need to eat
   that denominational poison. It’ll cause you to vomit it up on the table. The Bible said, in;
   Isaiah 28:8, that all tables are full of vomit. Glory to God. And they are eating their own vomit. I
   Love It! Oh, God!

   142 That stinking dead man was only thing he could point his fingers to, of his success, of forty
   years of training; a stinking Egyptian laying there, rotten and dead. 143 That’s about the way it
   is tonight. The only thing we can point, to this revival that’s crossed over (so-called), is a
   stinking bunch of church members that knows no more about God than a Hottentot would
   know about Egyptian night. Right. That, would tell them about the Word of God, they say, “I
   don’t believe That.” Say, “I don’t care what you say, I don’t believe It.” See? See? That’s an
   awful thing to have to point back to, for all the strains and struggles and everything we got.
   144 Maybe we could point to a big school, but it’s dead. We could point to an organization, but
   it’s dead. It’s stinking. It’s just like the first thing that we pulled out of. “Like a hog going to
   its wallow, and a dog to its vomit,” when we turn back. One dead Egyptian.
    One poor little preacher out in Arizona said, “Brother Bob how are you doing?
   I said, “Oh, pretty good.” He said, “Brother Bob what do you think about it?” I said, “It’s sure
   something, ain’t it. He said, I tell you, Brother Bob there’s only one thing for us to do and that’s
   get desperate for the prophet to come back in a tent ministry.” I said, “Yeah that’s sure
   something ain’t it.”
    No. Brother Bob don’t see nothing like that and I ain’t never gonna see nothing like that.
   Brother, if I don’t overcome daily by the power of the Holy Ghost, I’ve got to die like a grain of
   seed in the ground, that Jesus Christ may being forth fruit in me. Brother, if He revealed my
   name on the Book of Life of redemption that was hidden underneath the seal, then if He revealed
   my name there, then God’s got a work for me to do. Glory to God! And He’ll be faithful unto
   death to do it.

   It takes death to produce life. You’ve got to die to your own thinking. You’ve got to die to your
   own theology. You’ve got to die to your own self, to your own human ways. You’ve got to be
   regenerated, a new creature, a new creation. Before you can be that… You can’t be two at the
   same time; you got to die to one in order to be born in the other. It brings a mess, and it causes
   a mess too. But you’re—you got new life. What difference does it make? You got to do it.
   
   How many believe that God’s got a work for Brother Bob to do? My, everybody in here
   believes just like I do! I believe just like you do on it! Amen.
   When God said, when you can get His children believing one thing, when they all can
   believe on thing. Then the Seven Thunders can be revealed and you will hear a sound of a
   rushing mighty wind, and you will see the pillar of fire and it will set upon each one of them and
   they will begin to speak with tongues as the spirit gives utterance. We will begin to prophecy,
   heal the sick, raise the dead, and open the blinded eyes. And this gospel, HALLELUJAH of

   220 Goes from His mouth, a sharp two-edged sword, wake up the heathens. Something’s got
   to happen one of these days. Yes! The Word of God, His Name was the Word of God, the
   Word made manifest. Look, Jesus said, “Go into all the world,” Mark 16, His last salute to the
   church before He returns to reveal Himself in the church age. He commissioned the Church,
   “Go into all the world and preach the Gospel to every creature.” What? Preach the Gospel.
   Mark 16, “Preach the Gospel to every creature.” What is that? In other words, “demonstrate
   the power of the Holy Ghost,” had to be. 221 Now watch, “to every…” Not just teach the Word;
   He never said, “Go teach the Word.” He said, “Go preach the Gospel.” Not teach the Word,
   preach the Gospel. “And these signs shall follow them that believe this Gospel; in My Name
   they shall cast out devils, they shall speak with new tongues, if they would take up a serpent or
   drink a deadly thing it wouldn’t harm them; if they lay hands on the sick, they shall recover.”
   222 “And they went forth,” said the Scripture, “preaching everywhere; the Lord working with
   them, confirming the Word with signs following.” That’s the Gospel, the Gospel on display.
   61
   223 These signs shall follow how many? Unto the end of the world, to every age. There’s that
   little minority coming down through, holding that Light. No wonder Jesus said, “FEAR NOT,
   LITTLE FLOCK, IT’S YOUR FATHER’S GOOD WILL TO GIVE YOU THE KINGDOM.”
   THE LITTLE FLOCK; THE MINORITY ALWAYS, NOT THE MAJORITY.
    I’d like to say as the apostle Paul said, the Word of God is not bound, I don’t care what
   the preachers do! The light is shining on Malachi 4, it’s here! Amen! The message is here! It just
   takes somebody with faith to reach down and pick it up and begin to preach it. Amen! And if
   God can ever find a group of people that’ll believe that they have the Sword of the King, brother
   they’ll cut down every Philistine, they’ll cut down every Hittite. They’ll cut down everything
   that gets in their way. Can you say, Amen?

   God had made an atonement. 116 Now, “The Voice of the Throne.” Notice in this Throne,
   “before the Throne was the seven stars,” the Voice of the stars. “Voices,” you see. There was
   more in the Revelation 4 here, or 5, we find out, “And out of the Throne proceeded lightning,
   thunders, and voices.” Not one voice; “voices,” plural. What was it? God speaking to the
   church, reflecting Himself through the seven Spirits. When the true anointed of God speaks,
   it’s the Voice of God! To reject It is to remove the candlestick. See? “Voices,” the Voice of the

   I’ll take your pastor right away from you and move him out of his place; I’ll put him somewhere
   else where his…where I’ll reflect My Light that’ll shine.” Hmm! Wasn’t that solemn? 141 It’s
   time for the churches to repent. It’s time for Pentecost to get a lot of these little polished
   scholars out of the pulpits, and get the old-fashioned preacher in there that’ll tell you the
   Truth; not pat around and use the church for a meal ticket, big wages, and something like
   that, and psychology, and a few horse races, and soup suppers, and everything else. It’s time to
   get back to the Gospel. I don’t care how little you are, “Where two or three are gathered, I’ll—
   I’ll be in their midst.” 142 “Repent, unless I come and remove the candlestick; send him away,

   63-0728 - Christ Is The Mystery Of God Revealed
   William Marrion Branham
   337 John would have never know Him, no, sir, had the Holy Ghost not pointed out. See how
   God hides His mystery to the high, educated and everything? Look, every one of them people, in
   simplicity reveals it to whom He has predestinated to see it. Look here! Others standing by and
   never even seen the dove, they never heard no Voice, for it was ONLY SENT TO THAT
   PREDESTINATED SEED. PREDESTINATED! Certainly, was predestinated! 338 Why,
   Isaiah, seven hundred and twelve years before he was born, in the Spirit, raised up out of
   these human senses, and said, “There’s a voice of one crying in the wilderness, ‘Prepare the
   way of the Lord, and make His…’” 339 Then, if Isaiah could see it, couldn’t Malachi see the
   same thing for a predestinated last prophet, the sealing off all the prophets of the Old
   Testament, that main…THAT GREAT PROPHET STANDING THERE AT THE END OF
   THE AGE? See? He’s saying he’s predestinated. Certainly, he was. Malachi saw him, too. 340
   Jesus said, “If you can receive it, this is he who was spoken of, ‘I send My messenger before My
   face,’ Malachi 3, ‘to prepare the way before Me.’” See? Sure, he was predestinated to see that
   message. No wonder he could look yonder and see that dove coming down, that Light that was
   in the wilderness with Israel, coming, moving down. 341 The God Himself, saying, “This is
   My beloved Son in Whom I’m pleased to dwell in.” God and man becoming One. 342 “I bare

   64-0313 - The Voice Of The Sign
   William Marrion Branham
   57 And, now, there was the sign to attract the prophet. Now, there, that sign has GOT TO
   HAVE A VOICE. And when that voice spoke, if It would not have been Scriptural, I don’t
   believe the prophet would have listened to it. But watch how Scriptural the voice was that
   accompanied the sign, it proved it was God, for He said, “I have heard the groans of My people,
   and I remember the promise that I made to them.” See, the sign, then the Scriptural voice
   behind the sign. 58 Now that shows exactly what I’ve just background. It must be a sign from
   God, and, if it is, there is a Scriptural voice behind it, for the promise of that day. Not the same
   old school; the rabbis and things had been going through the schools, or the everything, all
   along, all along, the priests, and so forth. But this is something new, and it’s Scriptural, it’s a
   promise; and a sign to attract the prophet. 59 And then, He said now, before he goes down there,
   he has got to have something to a vindicate himself of being a prophet, see, before they would
   receive him. Said, “They won’t say the Lord has appeared to me.” 60 Said, “Then, I’ll give you
   64
   two signs to do, and that will attract the people’s attention. And when the attention of the
   people is attracted, then speak these words to them, ‘I’m the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob,
   and I remember My promise.’ And I’ve sent you down to deliver them, and I’ll be with you.” 61
   Did you notice his first sign? He had all kinds of impersonations of them. Everybody tried to
   throw down a serpent. That’s…If that ain’t the run of people, I don’t know what is, see. See? But
   what kind of a voice did they have behind it? Nothing; the Egyptian voice of the world. Yet they
   could perform the sign, but they didn’t have the voice behind it, to back it up. But Moses had
   THUS SAITH THE LORD. That was the difference. Impersonators finally went on for a long
   time, but finally it played out. 62 Do you know the Bible said that would take place again in the
   last days? “As Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so would man of reprobate mind
   concerning the Truth.” Who is Truth? Jesus Christ is Truth. See? “Reprobate mind
   concerning the Truth.” 63 NOW JEHOVAH IS GOING TO SPEAK BY HIS PROMISED
   WORD. He must then get this prophet ready to send down. Because, it’s always in His line of
   thinking, His line of doing, every time send His prophet with the Word, and a vindicates the
   prophet. 64 Again, this is a promised sign. A prophet, himself, is a sign. The Bible said so. When
   you see times lapsing, and then see coming… Take the history of the Bible, study it. Whenever
   you seen a long lapse of time; but just when you seen a prophet appear on, it was the sign of
   judgment. God was going to judge the world, when He…or the nation, or the people, when
   you saw a prophet coming. I’ve preached a sermon on it, you tape man remember, the…A True
   Sign Overlooked. They always overlook it, they always have, but it was a sign of a coming
   judgment. 65 NOW HIS WORD IS FULFILLED IN HIS VOICE. WHAT HE PROMISES,
   THEN HE FULFILLS HIS WORD BY THE VOICE. 66 The coming of a prophet is a
   warning sign that judgment is at hand. Always has been. Let me just quote one. 67 Look at
   Noah rising up in the last, in the—in the days of the antediluvian world, a prophet prophesying.
   What was it? Judgment struck immediately after. 68 Moses went into Egypt, a vindicated prophet
   with the signs of the prophet. What happened? Judgment struck Egypt right afterwards. 69 Elijah
   come on the scene, the prophet, and prophesied to Ahab and that nation. What happened?
   Judgment struck it right afterwards. Right. 70 John the Baptist come on, as a sign. He was a
   prophet. He was a prophet-sign come on the earth. THEY KNOWED, WHEN HE COME ON,
   THE MESSIAH WOULD SPEAK, AFTER HIM. It had to be, ’cause, get the—get the elected.
   71 What this is for is to get the elected people that’s coming out, like in the days of Noah. Like
   in the days of—of Elijah, the seven thousand or seven hundred, or whatever it was, that hadn’t
   bowed their knee, to call them out. JOHN CALLING OUT THE ELECTED, AND GIVE IT
   OVER TO CHRIST WHEN HE COME, SWAPPED HIS CHURCH, SAID, “I MUST
   DECREASE, HE MUST INCREASE, BECAUSE,” HE SAID, “I’M JUST A VOICE OF
   HIM, CRYING IN THE WILDERNESS, ‘PREPARE THE WAY FOR THE LORD.’” AND
   JESUS COME THE SAME WAY. GETS THE ELECTED READY TO HEAR THE VOICE
   OF GOD, THAT’S WHAT THE PROPHETIC SIGN IS. Oh, if you follow these Messages, get
   the per-…get the elected ready. Not the others, will never hear it. It’s the elected that’s called.
   72 Where did that Angel come to, in Sodom, that did that sign? To Abraham and his group.
   “Stay away from Sodom; it’s going to burn!” See? JESUS PROMISED IT TO REPEAT, you
   know, again, at this Sodom. Now notice. 73 What does it do? It gets the elected ready for the
   shelter of God, like in Noah’s time, so forth. 74 And what does it do? It condemns the
   intellectual unbeliever, to judgment. It always has. To spurn mercy, nothing left but judgment.
   So it gets the—the intellectual and the unbeliever ready for the judgment. Because, what do
   65
   they do? They condemn it.
   I told you to believe Amos 3:7. Amen. He said, He was gonna do something, and He’ll

   But I have been privileged, by God, to look and see what It was, see, see unfold to that much.
   Now, that is the Truth.

   Let’s turn over here now, to Revelation 22:17. Tie it up a little stronger. Amen! It’s like
   tying up a barge on a river, you throw that big rope out there and pull it up tight. Amen! Oh, God
   and we begin to hook it up line upon line, precept upon precept. Amen!
   Isaiah 28:10-Reference quote:
   10 For precept must be upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here
   a little, and there a little:
   All right it said here in Revelation 22:17 And the Spirit of Malachi 4… come on now!
   and the Bride say, come, COME WHAT? Come out of there, children. Did He say it! All right!
   Revelation 22:17-Reference quote:
   17 And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that
   is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.
    Now over here it says in Malachi 4:5 that the prophet, which was William Branham,
   would restore the faith. Is that right?
   Malachi 4:5-6-Reference quote:
   5 Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of
   the Lord:
   6 And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their
   fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.
   Now, I would like you to notice, that is not personal faith, that is not personal faith, but it
   is the faith of the fathers. It is the revealed body of truth that was hidden in the seven mysteries
   of God. Can you say amen! Then after Brother Branham revealed the mysteries that was in the
   Bible, which restored us back to the original Word. And when we got the original Word, God
   could once again deal with us like He’s getting ready to deal with the Jews in their homeland.
   The Bride is back in her homeland. And we’re lining up with the Word of God. Amen. We’re
   dying out to ourselves. We’re looking for the great appearing Jesus Christ in our midst. Can you
   say amen!
    All right, then over in John 3:22. We see Brother Branham’s ministry in John 3:22. Oh
   Glory to God! I love it!
   John 3:22.
   John 3:22-28-Reading
   22 After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judæa; and there he tarried
   with them, and baptized.
   23 And John also was baptizing in Ænon near to Salim, because there was much water there:
   and they came, and were baptized.
   24 For John was not yet cast into prison.
   25 Then there arose a question between some of John's disciples and the Jews about purifying.
   67
   26 And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to
   whom thou barest witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all men come to him.
   27 John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven.
   28 Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him.
   And that’s just what Brother Branham said. They kept saying you’re the Christ, you’re
   the Son of Man. He said, no I ain’t, no I’m not, I’m just a good for nothing. I’m just a good for
   nothing, get your eyes on Jesus. Is that right! Listen to this, “I am sent before him.” And here’s
   what I want to get to.

   that will forerun the Second Coming of Christ. That’s what the Angel of the Lord said. 385
   Now, now notice. Now, “As John the Baptist…” Now, all of you have heard that. You’ve read it

   Itself spoke that message, “As John the Baptist was sent forth to forerun the first coming of

   An Exposition Of The Seven Church Ages - 9 - The Laodicean Church Age
   William Marrion Branham
   Though he will not be popular, he will be vindicated by God. As Jesus authenticated John, and
   the Holy Ghost authenticated Jesus, we can well expect this man will be first of all
   authenticated by the Spirit working in his life in acts of power that are indisputable and found
   nowhere else; and Jesus Himself, in returning, will authenticate him, even as He
   68
   authenticated John. John witnessed that Jesus was coming, — and so will this man, like John,
   witness that Jesus is coming. AND THE VERY RETURN OF CHRIST WILL PROVE THAT
   THIS MAN INDEED WAS THE FORERUNNER OF HIS SECOND COMING. THIS IS
   THE FINAL EVIDENCE THAT THIS INDEED IS THE PROPHET OF MALACHI 4, FOR
   THE END OF THE GENTILE PERIOD WILL BE JESUS, HIMSELF, APPEARING. Then
   it will be too late for those who have rejected him. In order to further clarify our presentation of
   this last-day prophet, let us particularly note that the prophet of Matthew 11:12, was John the
   Baptist, who was the one foretold in Malachi 3:1, “Behold, I will send My messenger, and he
   shall prepare the way before Me; and the Lord, Whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to His
   temple, even the Messenger of the Covenant, Whom ye delight in: behold, He shall come, saith
   the Lord of Hosts.” Matthew 11:1-12, “And it came to pass, when Jesus had made an end of
   commanding His twelve disciples, He departed thence to teach and to preach in their cities. Now
   when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples, and said unto
   Him, Art thou He That should come, or do we look for another? Jesus answered and said unto
   them, Go and shew John again those things which ye do hear and see: the blind receive their
   sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and
   the poor have the Gospel preached to them. And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended
   in Me. And as they departed, Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning John, What went
   ye out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken with the wind? But what went ye out for to see?
   A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they that wear soft clothing are in kings’ houses. But
   what went ye out for to see? A prophet? yea, I say unto you, and more than a prophet. For this is
   he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send My messenger before Thy face, which shall prepare
   Thy way before Thee. Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there hath not
   risen a greater than John the Baptist: notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven
   is greater than he.” This has already taken place. This has happened. It is over. But note now in
   Malachi 4:1-6, “For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea,
   and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the
   Lord of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch. But unto you that fear My Name
   shall the Sun of Righteousness arise with healing in His wings; and ye shall go forth, and
   grow up as calves of the stall. And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under
   the soles of your feet in the day that I shall do this, saith the Lord of hosts. Remember ye the law
   of Moses My servant, which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel, with statutes and
   judgments. Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and
   dreadful day of the Lord: and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the
   heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.” See,
   immediately after the coming of THIS Elijah, the earth will be cleansed by fire and the wicked
   burned to ashes. Of course, this did NOT happen at the time of John (the Elijah for his day).
   The Spirit of God that prophesied the coming of the messenger in Malachi 3:1 (John) was but
   reiterating His previous prophetic statement of Isaiah 40:3 made at least three centuries
   previously. “The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord,
   make straight in the desert a highway for our God.” Now John, by the Holy Ghost, voiced both
   Isaiah and Malachi in Matthew 3:3, “For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias,
   saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make His
   paths straight.” So we can well see from these Scriptures that the prophet in Malachi 3, who
   was John, was NOT the prophet of Malachi 4, though indeed, both John and this last-day
   69
   prophet have upon them the same Spirit Which was upon Elijah. Now this messenger of
   Malachi 4 and Revelation 10:7 is going to do two things. One: According to Malachi 4 he will
   turn the hearts of the children to the fathers. Two: He will reveal the mysteries of the seven
   thunders in Revelation 10 which are the revelations contained in the seven seals. It will be
   these Divinely revealed “mystery-truths” that literally turn the hearts of the children to the
   Pentecostal fathers. Exactly so. But consider this also. This prophet-messenger will be in his
   nature and manners as were Elijah and John. The people of this prophet-messenger’s day will
   be as they were in Ahab’s day, and in John’s. And since it is “ONLY THE CHILDREN” whose
   hearts will be turned, it is only the children who will listen. In the days of Ahab only 7,000 trueseed Israelites were found. In the days of John there were also very few. The masses in both
   ages were in the fornication of idolatry. I want to make one more comparison between the
   Laodicean prophet-messenger and John, the prophet-messenger who preceded Jesus’ first
   coming. The people in John’s day mistook him for the Messiah. John 1:19-20, “And this is the
   record of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, WHO ART
   THOU? AND HE CONFESSED, AND DENIED NOT; BUT CONFESSED, I AM NOT THE
   CHRIST.” NOW THIS LAST-DAY PROPHET-MESSENGER WILL HAVE SUCH POWER
   BEFORE THE LORD THAT THERE WILL BE THOSE WHO MISTAKE HIM FOR THE
   LORD JESUS. (There will be a spirit in the world at the end time that will seduce some and
   make them believe this. Matthew 24:24-26, “For there shall arise false Christs, and false
   prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall
   deceive the very elect. Behold, I have told you before. Wherefore if they shall say unto you,
   Behold, He is in the desert; go not forth: behold, He is in the secret chambers; believe it not.”)
   But don’t you believe it. He is not Jesus Christ. He is not the Son of God. HE IS ONE OF
   THE BRETHREN, A PROPHET, A MESSENGER, A SERVANT OF GOD. He needs no
   greater honor bestowed upon him than that which John received when he was the voice that
   cried, “I am not He, BUT HE IS COMING AFTER ME.”
   He that hath the Bride is the Bridegroom. The friend of the bridegroom standeth and
   heareth him, and rejoiceth greatly because of the Bridegroom's Voice: this my joy therefore is
   fulfilled.

   little Place that slanted. I looked back, and there I was, laying on the bed. And I said, “This is a
   strange thing.” 137 Now, I would not want you to repeat this. This is before my church, or my
   sheep that I am pastoring. Whether it was, I was in this body or out, whether it was a translation,
   it wasn’t like any vision I ever had. I could look There, and I could look here. 138 And when I hit
   that little Place, I never seen so many people come running, screaming, “Oh, our precious
   brother!” 139 And I looked. And young women, maybe in their early twenties, eighteen to
   twenty, they were throwing their arms around me, and screaming, “Our precious brother!” 140
   Here come young men, in the brilliance of young manhood. And their eyes glistening and looking
   like stars on a darkened night. Their teeth as white as pearl. And they were screaming, and

   and, oh, they killed Him, He died. His soul descended into hell. Preached to the souls that are
   in prison. Taken the keys of death and hell away from the devil. Returned back on Easter
   morning. And as He come through Paradise, He knocked at the door, hallelujah, I can hear Him
   say, “Children!” Abraham say, “Who is That?” “I’m your Seed, the Seed of Abraham.” Daniel
   said, “Who is That?” “I’m the Stone that was cut out of the mountain.” 73 There they are, the
   Old Testament saints laying there, waiting to be clothed upon, in Paradise. He opened up the
   door. Abraham said, “Are we going out?” “It’s almost daylight on earth. Let’s get ready to go.”
   74 Abraham said, “Can we make a little whistle stop? I’d like to look the city over.” 75 “Well,
   yes, I’m going to visit with My disciples for forty days.” And on Easter morning He arose! 76
   And Matthew 27 says that, “Many of the bodies of the saints that slept in the dust of the earth,
   rose, and came out of the city, and appeared to many of them in the city.” 77 I can see Sarah and
   Abraham coming down the street, say, “Oh, honey, look there! They’ve changed these things a
   little bit. Look around here how this looks.” 78 Somebody said, “Who is that couple there? It
   seems like they’re strangers.” 79 They say, “We’re recognized.” [Brother Branham snaps his
   finger—Ed.], vanished out of their sight, like He went through the wall, you know, and they
   didn’t even know or see Him come in. Went out! They had glorified bodies, and they appeared
   back an earth, hallelujah, for a first fruits of the proof of God’s power and the resurrection.
   There they was. Robbed and stripped principalities, and took death and hell, smothered it up.
   And rose up on Easter morning, and entered into the Kingdom with Him. 80 No wonder they
   said, “Bury me in Palestine.” They knowed the resurrection was going to be in Palestine. 81
   Therefore, today, brother, you can have whatever you want to, all the old cold formal religion
   you want to, but, bury me in Christ, for those that are in Christ will God bring with Him in the
   75
   resurrection. Say whatever you want to, and call it fanaticism and whatever you want to do, but
   just let me stay in Him, for those that are in Him is coming out of the grave on the resurrection,
   for God shall bring them up. He promised to do it. Amen! 82 What difference does it make if
   you’re getting old? Well, glory to God! What does that have anything to do with it? Closer
   home! Amen. Oh, glory! Going to call me holy-roller, anyhow, you might as well get started. All
   right. How wonderful! That’s enough to make a holy-roller out of you. Why, how can I keep from
   being happy, and know that’s the Truth? Why, sure, I’m happy. And everybody that’s got that
   hope is bubbling up.

   117 A perfect type of Christ, was Moses. Is that right? All those patriarchs were Jesus Christ
   living pre-life-d. Moses born under persecution, just as they was killing all the babies in the time
   of Moses. Jesus, when He came, they was killing all the babies to get Him. Is that right? The
   devil trying to catch Moses, the devil trying to catch Jesus. He was trying! 118 I can see Jesus
   when He went up, down there, knocked on the door down there in hell, that morning. Hallelujah!
   (I don’t know whether it’s within—in me to teach that yet tonight.) When I can see Jesus when
   He died at Calvary, ascended, went down there and seen all those people back in there, weeping
   and wailing, and carrying on, said, “You ought to have listened to the prophets.” He preached to
   the souls that were in prison. “You had Enoch, you had the prophets, you had the laws, why
   didn’t you listen to it?” They didn’t. Closed went the door. 119 Went down to hell, knocked at
   the door. Satan said, “Who’s there?” 120 He said, “Come, open the door!” Oh, my! I’m just
   giving drama, of course. 121 Walked up to the door, and pulled open the door, and said, “Who
   are You?” Why, He said, “I am Jesus Christ.” 122 “Oh, so You finally got here, did You? Huh! I
   been after You for a long time, Boy.” “I know you have.” 123 “Now look! I thought I had You
   when I killed Abel. I thought I had You when I killed Moses. I thought I had You when I done all
   these things. When I got John the Baptist, I thought I had You sure. But now I got You, You’re
   here in my possession!” 124 I can hear Jesus Christ say, “I am the virgin-born Son of God. I
   came from the ivory palaces of My Father, and I came to the earth. And on the earth, is
   bathed this morning with My Blood that I gave, and paid the price of death, sin, and hell. Give
   Me those keys!” Hallelujah! “I’m taking over from here on. You’ve kept the people in
   bondage, you’ve kept them in fear and everything else, but I’ll take over from this on!”
   Hallelujah! Took them off and hung them on His Own side, pushed him back in hell, and
   walked away. Amen. Amen! 125 The Mighty Conqueror, since He rent the veil in two, lo,
   behold Him in full view! The Mighty Conqueror rose up, said, “I am He that was dead, is alive
   again, and I’m alive for evermore, and have the keys of death and hell.” Hallelujah! “He that
   heareth My Words and believeth on Him that sent Me, hath everlasting Life. I’ve got the keys
   of the resurrection, I’ll raise him up in the last day.” That satisfies me. Amen! “I am He.”
   Amen. Oh, my!

   All right now. Once again, the church world has done the same thing, they have crucified
   the message of Malachi 4. There Malachi 4 message, Shout message hung upon the cross. They
   made fun of it, said poor little ole ignorant Kentucky hillbilly. Talked about the seed of the
   serpent, predestination and the Bride, the grace, and all these great mysteries - they laughed at
   him. They crucified him to the congregations, the false prophets did. They hung the message
   and crucified Jesus Christ afresh again. Amen! And Brother Branham indicted that generation, in
   the tape indicted, he indicted them for crucifying Jesus Christ afresh. Amen!

   63-0707M - The Indictment
   William Marrion Branham
   1. 232 They rejected God’s Word made manifest, for their creeds, and they’re doing the same
   today. “He was the Word,” John, Saint John 1. Hebrews 13:8 says, “He’s the same yesterday,
   today, and forever.” Now they are crucifying Him afresh. 233 Did you know the Bible said we
   could do that? How many would like to read just a little bit? Will you give me another fifteen
   minutes of it? [Congregation says, “Amen.”—Ed.] All right. Let’s turn over now, just a minute,
   a “crucified afresh.” Let’s go over to Hebrews, the 6th chapter, and read just a little bit.
   Hebrews the 6th, and see if we “crucify the Son of God afresh,” see if it can be done. You say,
   “You can’t crucify Him the second time.” 234 We’ll find out whether we can or not. God’s
   Word is true. Is that right?
   2. 257 So that’s what this nation has done. That’s what this people has done. That’s what these
   churches has done. They’ve turned It down, and they’ve crucified the Message. They’ve
   crucified the Truth, to the people. How’d they do Jesus? They put Him to shame, stripped His
   clothes off of Him, hung Him up on a cross and nailed Him up there, the Prince of Life. The
   same thing they’ve done today with their creeds! They’ve done the same thing. They stripped the
   things, they’ve stripped the—the goodness and the clothing of the Gospel, by trying to place It
   somewhere else, and hung Him on a cross. Oh, my! Why? 258 “There they—there they
   crucified,” now the last quotation, “Him,” Him, this most precious Person. Why did they do it?
   They didn’t know Him. Why they doing it today? They don’t know this is the Truth. They’re—
   they’re dumb and blind of It. They don’t know It. That’s the reason. Their creeds and
   traditions has gotten them away from the Word of God.
   3. 265 Now what did they do? They didn’t know it. Today men walk ignorantly. They don’t
   know that’s the Truth. They think it’s some kind of a ism. They don’t dig down deep enough to
   get into the Spirit of revelation. They don’t pray enough. They don’t call upon God enough.
   266 They just lightly take It, “Oh, well, I believe there’s a God. Sure!” The devil believes the
   same thing. The devil believes it more than some people claim to believe. The devil believes it
   and trembles. People just believe it and go on. But the devil trembles, knowing his Judgment is
   coming, and people believe it and don’t pay no attention the Judgment is coming. 267 Guilty of
   crucifying Him! Sure! I indict this generation, finding them guilty, by the same Word that
   found them guilty at the beginning. That’s right. Jesus said, “Who can condemn Me?” He
   was the Word made flesh. And today the same Word is made flesh.
   77
   4. 346 The very same thing today, “Away with the Holy Ghost,” they don’t want nothing to do
   with It. “It condemns and does these things, and tells our people these things we don’t want to
   get mixed amongst our organizations. It’s against our creeds.” They crucify Him again. Oh,
   my! Notice now as we’re closing. Got to close. And, again, they call It “fanaticism.” 347 And
   they called Him a “fanatic.” They said, “He was crazy.” Anybody knows that the Bible said
   that, “Jesus was,” them Pharisees said, “this Man is a Samaritan, and He’s mad.” Now what
   does the word mad mean? “Crazy.” “The Man is crazy. They’re a bunch of crazy people follow
   Him. He is Beelzebub.” 348 And, again, they say the same thing, “It’s a sort of witchcraft. It’s
   fortune-telling,” placing Him again on the cross of shame. What cross? What shame? His a
   vindicated Word; making fun of It, telling the people It’s the devil. Making something, and call…
   349 He said, “They calling the holy works of God ‘an unclean spirit doing it,’ no forgiveness for
   it.” 350 Making shame of His Word, trying to expose It and call It a fake or fanaticism, “Don’t
   go to it. Don’t attend them meetings.” Uh-huh. 351 What do they do by doing that? They take
   their denominational creed nails. That’s right. These pleasure-hunting teachers, worldly,
   ungodly, denominational mad, take the denominational nails and crucify the Son of God with it,
   afresh, from their pulpits. 352 Why do they do this? “They love the praises of men,” the degrees
   that the church can give them, “more than the love of the Word of God.” I condemn them. They
   can’t conform to the world, because they’re…Can’t conform to the Word, because they’re
   already conformed to the world. They’ve already done it. The hypocritical day that we live in! Is
   not this… 353 Is not one Calvary enough for my Lord? Why will you do this? You that’s
   supposed to love Him, you that knows This is His Word, you that can read Revelation the 22nd
   chapter, say, “Whoever will take one Word or add one word,” why do you do it? Isn’t one
   Calvary enough for Him? 354 I stand in His defense. I’m His attorney, and I indict you by the
   Word of God. Change your ways or you’ll go to hell. Your denominations will crumble. I indict
   you in the Presence of the Judge, right, you, with your forms of godliness, hypocrisies. And why
   do you call It…Ain’t one Calvary enough? 355 As Peter said, “Your denominational fathers,”
   Peter indicted you by the…Said, “Which of your fathers hasn’t done this?” Stephen done the
   same thing: “With wicked hands you’ve crucified the Prince of Life.” Didn’t Jesus say, Hisself,
   “Which one of your fathers didn’t put the prophets in the tombs? And you garnish them
   afterwards”? So has it been to the righteous man down through the ages! 356 So do I indict this
   high-polished, church-going bunch of Christ-rejecting people of this day. You, with your forms
   of godliness, crucify my Christ the second time, by telling the people, that, “These Words are
   for some other day, and It isn’t for this day.” I indict you. You’re guilty of the same crime that
   they was, on the day of the crucifixion. Repent and turn to God, or perish. 357 And again I
   say, “Here,” the churches, “they,” the teachers, “crucify,” by blasphemy, “Him,” the Word.
   God be merciful! Let me say that again. It might have been mixed up on the tape. “Here,” the
   churches, “they,” the clergy, “crucify,” by blasphemy, “Him,” the Word. No wonder it’s again:
   Mid rending rocks and darkening skies My Saviour bowed His head and died, But the opening
   veil revealed the way To Heaven’s joys and endless day. 358 I say it on this tape, and for this
   audience. I say this under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost. Who is on the Lord’s side, let him
   come under this Word! God will surely bring this wicked, Christ-denying, Christ-rejecting
   generation into judgment, for blasphemy, the crucifixion of His identified Word. They are
   coming to the Judgment. I indict it! “Who is on the Lord’s side,” said Moses, “let him come
   unto me,” when the Pillar of Fire hanging there as an evidence. Who is on the Lord’s side, let
   78
   him take up the Word, deny his creed, and follow Jesus Christ daily. And I’ll meet you in the
   morning.
   All right now. There hangs the message of Malachi 4 upon the cross of all the
   denominational doors. There they crucified Christ again and hung him up outside of the church
   doors, there he hangs, with laughing’s and mocking’s and criticism. But Oh, God, here comes
   now the message and ministry of the Third Pull, to come and haunt all those people in those
   denominational churches that rejected Brother Branham’s ministry, Jesus Christ. He descends in
   the capstone ministry and comes into them churches and haunt’s them souls that rejected the
   message. Brother, you talk about a terrible time it’s going to be for them.
   Amen, are you getting it? Now let’s look over here in Joshua. Now it said Jericho was
   straightly shut up because of the children of Israel, and none went out and none came in. Amen!
   Eighth verse.
   Joshua 6:8. “And it came to pass, when Joshua had spoken unto the people, that the
   seven priests bearing the seven trumpets” Come on now! Seven church ages, seven trumpets,
   seven seals, seven plagues - seven woe’s, Amen! Bearing the seven trumpets of Ram horns
   passed on before the Lord, and blew with the trumpets: and the ark of the covenant of
   the Lord followed them.
   And the armed men went before the priests that blew with the trumpets, and the rearward
   came after the ark, the priests going on” That’s Joshua 6, 1 and through ten. “and blowing the
   trumpets.”
   Listen now, here we are here’s where I want to come to. “
   And Joshua had commanded the people, saying, Ye shall not shout, nor make any noise
   with your voice, neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I bid you shout;
   then shall ye shout.”
   Now on the tape, The Spoken Word is the Original Seed, Brother Branham said, these
   predestinated supernatural race of people, with a ministry just like Jesus Christ. They will be
   trained to conformed to the very image by the message Shout …, the Shout message of Malachi
   4. Amen! They will never speak unless He tells them to speak. They’ll never utter their Voice.
   But when God tells them to SPEAK, they shall speak and it’ll be THUS saith the Lord. And God
   will create right before their eyes what they say.

   34 Now, notice, then the Coming of the Lord Jesus is so close at hand until the Spirit from way
   down in here…just barely justification, sanctification, baptism of the Holy Spirit, and now right
   into the time of the coming of the Headstone. The Church has got to be so perfectly like Christ
   until Christ and the Church can unite together, the same Spirit. And if the Spirit of Christ is in
   you, It makes you live the life of Christ, act the life of Christ, do the works of Christ. “He that
   believeth on Me, the works that I do shall he do also.” Jesus said that. See? Now we’re going
   to have, we got a ministry coming that’s just exactly like the life of Christ. What does that
   ministry identify? The Coming of the Lord.

   Rev. William Marrion Branham
   Now, here is what I'm trying to say to you. The law of reproduction, bring forth of its kind,
   Genesis 1:11. These last days, true Church-Bride comes to the Headstone, will be the super
   Church, a super Race, as the… nears the great Headstone. They will be much like, so much
   like Him, even they will be in His very image, in the order to being united with Him. They will
   be One. They will be the very manifestation of the Word of the living God.
   420 Notice what harmony! Jesus never did anything until seen of the Father, or, the Father
   showed Him first. Harmony between God and Christ, see, John 5:19. So will the Bride, and He
   shows Her His Word of Life. He shows Her, and She receives It. She never doubts It. Nothing
   can harm Her, not even death. For if the Seed be planted, the water will raise It up again.
   (Amen. Then I got a great big "Hallelujah!") Here is the secret. The Word is in the Bride, and
   the mind of Christ, to know what He wants done with the Word. And She does it in His Name.
   She has THUS SAITH THE LORD. Then It is germitized, so the Holy Spirit waters it until it is
   grown and serves its purpose.

   60-0313 - Hear Ye Him
   William Marrion Branham
   37 Now, you see, Jesus had proven to God that He’d been the right kind of Son. And God took
   Him up on the top of the mountain, brought witnesses out there—heavenly witnesses and earthly
   witnesses—and He clothed Him in immortality. When they looked up, they said, “His garments
   shined like the sun.” A supernatural something taken place. His garments glistened like the sun
   in its middle of the day, as white as they could be. God placed on Him that robe of immortality,
   showing that He had received Him. That’s the thing that God will do to His sons here on earth
   someday. He will call you aside, Church, if you’ll only obey Him and stay on the Word and
   believe it. And He will place into the Church, before the coming of Jesus Christ… He will
   place into the Church… All the powers that Christ had in Him will be in the Church. All that
   God was, He poured into Jesus; all that Jesus was, He pours into the Church. God wanting
   80
   His work done, He sent it into His Son; the Son wanting the work done, sent it into the
   Church. “At that day you’ll know that I’m in the Father, the Father in Me, and I in you, and
   you in Me.” At that day, because the same power of God, was in Jehovah God, rested in Jesus
   Christ. The same power that rested in Jesus Christ, rests in the placed sons in the body of
   Christ. 38 Placing of a son… Take him out in a certain place, have a ceremony before Angels,
   and place him positionally what he is in the body of Christ. Then that person has the
   authority. Let me say this, if you count me a fanatic from this night on. That very same thing that
   I’m speaking of will be done. THERE’LL BE A POWER PUT INTO THE CHURCH, AND
   NOW IS COMING IN, THAT THE HOLY SPIRIT WILL SO ANOINT THE PEOPLE, TILL
   THEY’LL SPEAK THE WORD AND IT’LL CREATE ITSELF RIGHT THERE. WE
   HAVEN’T SEEN POWERS LIKE’S COMING INTO THE CHURCH NOW. I know it for a
   fact. “Say unto this mountain be moved. Don’t doubt in your heart, but believe that what
   you’ve said shall come to pass, you can have what you have said”: the placing of the Church
   in position, where the fulness of the power of the Holy Ghost comes into the Church. Then
   critics’ mouths will be shut. It’ll be a short time. Jesus come right off the mountain, went
   straight to Calvary. Notice, it won’t last long, but it’ll be here.
   All right, now you notice here that Joshua is a type. Oh, I feel like jumping up on this
   piano. I said, Joshua is a type of the book of Ephesians. And Brother Branham said God is
   restoring a church, and it’s an Ephesians church. And it said that Ephesians Parallels Joshua.

   Now as we study together, I’d like to say this, that this Book of Ephesians perfectly parallels the
   Old Testament Joshua. Ephesians, the Book of Ephesians.
   So, here we have an Ephesians church, Glory to God! Commanded not to shout, not to
   speak a thing, until the Lord Commands them to speak. Alright! And He said, “Go around the
   walls of Jericho.” Now Jericho represents the denominations that rejected the message of Moses.
   Amen! They have rejected the message of Moses.

   75 And He dealt with the lowest, most poorest of people. And He was rejected by the highest of
   societies. He was rejected by His Own, the church that ought to have known Him, but they
   didn’t. They wasn’t trained in the Word, to know Him. 76 And we find again that He went to
   the lowest city that was in Palestine, Jericho. I forget how many feet below sea level it is, way
   81
   low. He stooped Himself so low until the smallest man of the city had to climb up in a tree to look
   down on Him. 77 But that’s what the world thought of Him. They give Him the most crucial,
   hardest death that any man could die; He died as a malefactor. The most disgraceful that He
   could die, stripped His clothes off of Him; and, ’course, you see on the statues, and so forth, they
   got a cloth around Him. “But He despised the shame.” They stripped His clothes completely
   from Him, nailed Him to a cross, in shame. The lowest, hardest death that could be given, they
   give it to Him. And that’s what the world thought of Him. 78 But God thought of Him till He
   give Him a Name above every name that’s named in Heavens or in earth. Exalted Him so high
   till, His throne so high, He has to look down to see Heaven. That’s what God thought of Him.
   I’m sure that’s our thoughts this morning, too. It’s above every name, above every name that
   could be named. Even the whole family in Heaven and earth is named “Jesus.” And by this
   Name, every—every knee shall bow, and every tongue shall confess to It. 79 Zacchaeus was
   just a—a businessman in the city of Jericho. And he was no doubt a—a fine man in his way.
   He—he was, let’s say, I believe, being a fine man as he was, he must have belonged to some
   church, one of the denominations of that day. Let’s say he was a Pharisee.

   63-1128E - The Token
   William Marrion Branham
   133 God is in His Word, for He is the Word. That’s exactly. “I have heard.” And faith cometh
   not by hearing the council, but the Word. Hearing the Word! 134 They seen this, and they
   knowed. She knowed it was the truth. She asked for mercy, watch, for both her and her family.
   She asked for her and her family, just like they did in Egypt. 135 Notice, there was given to her a
   token, a red token. That the scarlet string that she let the people, the spies, down out of the
   window, was to be a token. God would not, destroying angel… God’s destroying angel would
   not come near her as long as she had that token. But, and what if she’d say, “Oh, I let them
   down. I done—done a good deed. So now to keep anybody from criticizing me, and seeing this
   scarlet rope hanging out here, I’ll pull the rope back up”? Then the…the judgment angel would
   have never passed over her house. She had to have the token displayed. It had to remain there.
   136 Hallelujah! Oh, it means “praise our God,” in these hours. Remember this. I’m not in here
   for a living. I’m not in here preaching for a living. No, sir. I can work for that, yet. I don’t do this
   for that. If I thought that there was any other way besides this right…Remember, this is I, I’ve
   got to meet God. It’s my soul. It’s got to be me. It’s not only me, but I’d have more
   condemnation. The Word of God is God. That’s God’s program that’s laying there, and that’s
   the Truth. 137 I believe that the scarlet thread had to be displayed, or the angel, destroying
   angel, would have never honored anything else but that token when it was displayed. The
   messengers gave her a token, and she must keep it displayed. 138 Notice, Jericho had heard
   what God had done, but did nothing to take the warning. 139 The world today, it’s not shut up
   in a side somewhere, the whole world knows these things goes on. The whole world has known.
   The Episcopalians, the Catholic, the Lutheran, all the denominations know that there is a God
   that works in His Word in this day, and keeps His signs and wonders moving. It’s not just shut
   up in a corner. They heard It, but they did not want to receive It. They had. 140 His great
   Power and His signs had been played, displayed, but they didn’t want to receive It. Just the
   same as it was in Sodom, His great signs and wonders had been displayed there, but they didn’t
   82
   want to receive It. So there wasn’t nothing left but judgment, was next. They must believe the
   whole Word, to be safe. But they thought they were safe, perhaps, in their great big
   organization of Jericho, their city. They thought that was good enough, but it wasn’t so. 141
   BUT ONE LITTLE HARLOT. THERE MUST HAVE BEEN SOME TAPE BOYS SLIPPED
   IN THERE AND PLAYED SOME OF THE TAPES. THE—THE PREDESTINATED SEED
   CAUGHT IT AND BELIEVED IT. So, anyhow, they got in there for a message. They had
   church that night in her house. She used her house for a church, to receive the message. 142 O
   God, let us open our hearts and receive the Message, that Jesus is alive tonight. He is right here
   among us. He is the same yesterday, today, and forever. Open up your house and let the
   Messenger, the Holy Ghost, come in and identify you by His Own Presence, the Token that’s
   upon you. Then you don’t have to take anybody else’s word for it, He is there to speak for
   Himself. And He is the Word. That’s right. It’s God’s Token, to identify His Ownself. 143 She
   used her house for the messengers. Then she got all the city, that would believe, under the same
   token. 144 And that’s the way the church should be doing today, getting everything that will
   believe, under the Token. The Token is the Holy Ghost. Just remember, they must get under
   the Holy Ghost. 145 And when God had destroyed his angels…The destroying angel come
   through, and when they seen the sign of the token, her house stood. The rest of Jericho fell
   down. But just the sounding of the trumpet, just think, and the whole walls fell down. They
   went straightway and utterly slayed everything there was in there, but all that was under that
   token was safe. Why? The messenger of God had come. They had told them the truth and they
   got under the token. Yes, sir. But many of them didn’t want to believe it. So if they didn’t want
   to believe it, they had to take the circumstances. 146 Same life that was in the token at Egypt,
   see, life, same thing like the life token in Egypt. 147 When they put the string down, that was the
   token. In that Gentile world, there was no blood applied for them yet, but they give a symbol of
   the red, of the token. So, when they saw the token; Joshua, a type of Jesus, was true to the token
   and sign that his messengers had preached, when Joshua give orders that no one should walk
   up to that house where that token was (no, sir), because no one was to be killed under that
   token. And Joshua really means “Jehovah Saviour,” same as Jesus does. And when HE SENT
   HIS MESSENGERS, JOSHUA, ANOTHER TYPE TO THE GENTILE WORLD, AND THE
   GENTILE, THAT LITTLE MINORITY THAT BELIEVED AND DISPLAYED THIS
   TOKEN, EVEN THE DESTROYING ANGEL RECOGNIZED THAT TOKEN. See? That’s
   the only thing He’ll recognize today.
   But now here comes the Ephesians, Bride, the resurrected Ephesians church that’s sitting
   in heavenly places with Christ Jesus, with the gifts of the spirit in operation! Hallelujah to God!
   AND THEY HAVE A GREAT WEAPON, A SWORD, THE SWORD OF THE KING.
   HALLELUJAH!
   And there they go around Jericho, the denominations, and when they go around Jericho
   it’s at the Seventh Trumpet. Glory to God! And when the Trumpet of God shall sound, Oh
   Hallelujah! The Bride will go out into Jericho and there they will go in and demonstrate the
   creative power of God. And when the children of the converts of Brother Branham in the
   Assemblies of God, in the United Pentecost, and around the world, see the great ministry of the
   Bridegroom in the Bride, they will come pouring out of them denominations, screaming and
   crying for the Holy Ghost!

   65-1126 - Works Is Faith Expressed
   William Marrion Branham
   24 I had a dream, the other morning. I don’t dream very often, I’m not a dreamer. But I—I
   dreamed that I seen a man, a young fellow in shackels, and he was trying to get out, and—and I
   said…Somebody told me, said, “Those are horrible people, don’t have nothing to do with them.”
   25 And I seen this young fellow getting out of his shackel so I just let him alone. I thought, “I’ll
   just see what he does.” So when he got out, he was a nice fellow. And I seen others trying to get
   out. 26 Now, this is only a dream. And I walked over this way and I seen a—a brother, Roy
   Borders, a very good friend of mine, lives in California. Looked like there’s something wrong,
   his eyes was half closed, and great big…maybe cancer or something over his eyes. And
   I…someone was trying to pull me away from him. I screamed, “Brother Borders! In the Name
   of the Lord Jesus, snap out of that!” 27 And he just barely could speak, saying, “Brother
   Branham, it’ll have to take something more than this. I just can’t grasp it, Brother Branham.
   I just can’t grasp it.” 28 I said, “O Brother Borders.” I love him. 29 And someone pulled me
   away, and I looked, and it was a lady standing over here that I, when I was a little boy, I—I used
   to haul groceries from the grocery store to the peoples. And her name was Mrs. Fenton, she lives
   in Jeffersonville yet, a personal friend to the wife and I. 30 And she said, “Brother Branham,
   deliver us from this.” Said, “This is a house of hell.” And said, “You’ve been misunderstood.”
   And said, “These…And you—you misunderstood these people, too.” Said, “These are fine
   people, but…” And I looked over there, and like a great big cellar, or—or big walls, down
   beneath a great big cave; and great iron bars, eight or ten inches thick. And people, out of
   their mind, twisted arms and legs, beating their head like that. And she was crying, saying,
   “Deliver the people, Brother Branham.” Said—said, “Help us, we’re in trouble.” She herself,
   I know her, she belongs to the…I believe the church of Christ, or the Christian church, called
   Church of the Brethren. So she… 31 I looked around, and I said, “I wished I could.” And go
   on, looking around; and I…my little, bitty body and—and them great, big iron bars; and those
   poor people in there. And you couldn’t get to them, them iron bars was setting close together.
   And I looked, and they were beating their head like they were out of their mind. 32 And I seen
   some lights flickering around in there. And I looked up, and there stood the Lord Jesus with
   a—a—a lights of rainbow around Him. He was looking right straight to me, said, “Deliver
   those people.” And He went away. 33 And I thought, “Well, how could I deliver them? I—I
   84
   haven’t got strength enough in my arms to break those bars.” 34 SO I SAID, “HOUSE OF
   HELL, GIVE AWAY TO THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST.” 35 AND ALL THE CREAKING
   AND POPPING, AND—AND ROCKS ROLLING, AND—AND BARS FALLING; AND
   PEOPLE RUNNING, SCREAMING,“DELIVERED!” AND SCREAMING AT THE TOP OF
   THEIR VOICE, AND WAS ALL DELIVERED. 36 AND I WAS SCREAMING THEN,
   “BROTHER ROY BORDERS, WHERE ARE YOU? WHERE ARE YOU? GOD IS
   DELIVERING HIS PEOPLE! Where are you, Brother Borders?” I’ve wondered about that. 37
   You know, Brother Borders is very scared. You know the prophecy, all…many of you do, you
   take the tapes and so forth, about the West Coast.
   
    The Bible said, that the five foolish virgins come to the Bride and said, give me this great
   power, give me this great creative power of the Holy Ghost! And they said, there is not time, the
   blood has left the mercy seat and it’s time to go into the rapture. And there will be weeping,
   wailing, and gnashing of teeth when they see the great demonstration of that!
   Brother, can you see them two hundred thousand people coming stomping and roaring
   out of the Assemblies of God, United Pentecostals, Baptist, Methodist, and Presbyterian? The
   Bible said, and there was a multitude that no man can number that come out of the great
   tribulation. And those are Brother Branham’s converts and many others too. Can you say,
   Amen?
   Brother Branham’s tapes have gone around the world. They’ve went into Africa, Asia,
   China, the Philippines, Hawaii, Holland every nick and corner of the earth. Them tapes have
   went and sowed the seed of Malachi 4, and then God underneath the Seventh Seal ministry,
   raises up the great ministry a great apostolic ministry of the Bride of Christ and there They go
   around the world demonstrating and riding the White Horse one more time ministry, Glory to
   God! Around the world, for a witness and then shall the end come! Glory to God! There will
   come all God’s children out of those denominations. When she says, “Come out of there!” Oh
   my! Oh my, we ought to be shot through! Raise your hands and Praise him! Do you believe it?
   Say thank you, Jesus! Glory to God!

   60-0313 - Hear Ye Him
   William Marrion Branham
   Now, if that son proven to be a right kind of a son (loved the father’s business, stayed right with
   his instructions), the father then on a certain day took that son out before the public, set him
   up on a high place, clothed him in a beautiful garment, and he had what they call the
   adoption of a son, or placing a son positionally what he was. They had a ceremony, and then
   the father said, “This, my son, I adopt him or place him positionally.” And if they had checks
   in those days, that son’s name on the check was just as good as his father’s name was, ’cause
   he was placed. And the son could fire who he wanted to; he could hire who he wanted to; he
   was in full possession of all the father had. 37 Now, you see, Jesus had proven to God that
   He’d been the right kind of Son. And God took Him up on the top of the mountain, brought
   witnesses out there—heavenly witnesses and earthly witnesses—and He clothed Him in
   85
   immortality. When they looked up, they said, “His garments shined like the sun.” A
   supernatural something taken place. His garments glistened like the sun in its middle of the
   day, as white as they could be. God placed on Him that robe of immortality, showing that He
   had received Him. That’s the thing that God will do to His sons here on earth someday. He
   will call you aside, Church, if you’ll only obey Him and stay on the Word and believe it. And He
   will place into the Church, before the coming of Jesus Christ… He will place into the Church…
   All the powers that Christ had in Him will be in the Church. All that God was, He poured into
   Jesus; all that Jesus was, He pours into the Church. God wanting His work done, He sent it
   into His Son; the Son wanting the work done, sent it into the Church. “At that day you’ll know
   that I’m in the Father, the Father in Me, and I in you, and you in Me.” At that day, because
   the same power of God, was in Jehovah God, rested in Jesus Christ. The same power that
   rested in Jesus Christ, rests in the placed sons in the body of Christ. 38 Placing of a son…
   Take him out in a certain place, have a ceremony before Angels, and place him positionally
   what he is in the body of Christ. Then that person has the authority. Let me say this, if you
   count me a fanatic from this night on. That very same thing that I’m speaking of will be done.
   There’ll be a power put into the Church, and now is coming in, that the Holy Spirit will so
   anoint the people, till they’ll speak the Word and It’ll create Itself right there. We haven’t seen
   powers like’s coming into the Church now. I know it for a fact. “Say unto this mountain be
   moved. Don’t doubt in your heart, but believe that what you’ve said shall come to pass, you
   can have what you have said”: the placing of the Church in position, where the fulness of the
   power of the Holy Ghost comes into the Church. Then critics’ mouths will be shut. It’ll be a
   short time. Jesus come right off the mountain, went straight to Calvary. Notice, it won’t last
   long, but it’ll be here.
    Now Joshua, the Ephesians church, circled around Jericho. The Bible said that Jericho
   was straightly shut up. Brother, it’s gonna be straightly shut up by the World Council of
   Churches. They’ll straightly shut Jericho up and you can’t come in. The only way you can get in
   to them children is wait until God bids you to shout. DON’T YOU SEE WHY I KEEP
   PREACHING TO THE MINISTERS TO WAIT ON GOD, DON’T GO UNTIL GOD SENDS
   YOU.
   That is why I’m in Connecticut! I’m waiting! I’m longing for that day when God says go,
   and will not go until He says go. How many is waiting for that Voice. Oh God, I know that the
   World Council of Churches is straightly shutting up Jericho and the devil’s thinking he can
   straightly shut it up. And that God’s great bridegroom, Voice, can’t get in there, to say come out
   of there my children, that heard my prophet, Brother Branham. But oh glory to God, Joshua the
   Ephesians church, knew that God was gonna crumble them walls down, so that the Bride could
   get in there. And it’s a spiritual wall now, it’s a spiritual wall now. Gory to God! There’s two
   hundred thousand, thousand demons walled around the denominations and is gonna try to get
   you, too. Can you say, Amen?
   But when that old Ephesians church, Joshua, the type of the Holy Ghost in the Ephesians
   church, commanded the Bride to go to Jericho, go around it, circles around it, and when the
   Seventh Trumpet sounds, there you shall cry out with the Shout of Malachi 4, Come out of there
   and believe the Word of God. And brother, here come Rahab out of there. Brother, this is so
   good!
   86
   I said there came Rahab out of there and all of her house. Can you just raise your hands!
   We can’t praise God enough! The world is starving and we’re feasting upon the mana from
   heaven. We’re sitting in heavenly places with Christ Jesus this morning, feasting upon his Word.
   Glory to God. And there the Shout message of the Bride and the Voice of the Bridegroom say
   come out of there that you may not be partakers of her sins and her plagues that she is gonna
   receive in the tribulation. If you stay in there, little children, God will pour out the plagues upon
   you and He will burn you in hell.
   Revelation 18:4-Reference quote:
   4 And I heard ANOTHER VOICE from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye
   be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.

   SON OF MAN AND THE LITTLE BOOK 3-21-71 a.m.
   Robert Lambert
   1. Notice -- He was a lamb during seven church ages, but now after the church ages are over, He
   comes with a different kind of a ministry now. A different kind of ministry altogether. It's not
   a lamb, but a lion ministry.
   2. But now here He comes as the Lion of the Tribe of Judah. Judah was the one that guarded
   the EASTERN GATE and Judah was the Lion whose birthstone was Leo. LEO IS JULY
   AND JULY IS HARVEST TIME. SO HE COMES AS THE LION OF THE TRIBE OF
   JUDAH TO REAP THE HARVEST.
    This is what God promised through Malachi 4. This is that, that was promised by Malachi
   4. That He would pour out the Holy Ghost upon the Bride and this is that, that your seeing now!
   And they come screaming and crying up out of them denominations. And they begin to wail and
   gnash their teeth.
   And about that time… remember now the Seventh…the Seventh Trumpet has sounded!
   Oh my! The Seventh trumpet has sounded and what does it do? It brings a call out of the
   denominations to all the converts of God, that’s justified. Amen! THERE ARE THOUSANDS
   AND UNTOLD THOUSANDS THAT ARE BLINDED BY THESE HYPOCRITES, DEMON
   POSSESSED FALSE PROPHETS. I SAID FALSE PROPHETS.
   ANY PREACHER THAT IS NOT PREACHING THE SHOUT MESSAGE OF
   MALACHI 4, IS A FALSE PROPHET AND IS DOOMED FOR HELL AND THE
   JUDGEMENTS OF THE WHIRL-WIND. Glory to God.

   67 Oh, you false teachers listening to these tapes all these years, and seeing God confirm
   exactly what He said, and you set in your study and know it’s the Truth; and because of your
   denominational differences, you dispute them and tell your people they’re not so. Woe unto
   you! Your time is close at hand. 68 Balaam, anointed with the same Spirit that was upon Moses.
   What was the difference? The teaching of Moses was perfect. The Bible said here in Second
   Peter, that it was “the teaching of Balaam” that Israel received, that God never did forgive.
   Unpardonable sin! Not a one of them got saved, though they had come out under the blessings
   of God, and seen the hand of God moving by this mighty prophet, and seen it exactly
   vindicated by God. And, because, another prophet come in with a teaching, contrary, and
   disputed with Moses, and tried to prove to the people that Moses was wrong. And Dathan,
   Korah, and many of them, agreed with him and taught the children of Israel to commit
   fornications, to go after his organization, that, “We’re all the same.” “Whether we’re
   Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian, or Pentecostals, and whatmore, we’re all the same.” 69 We are
   not the same! Ye are a separated people, holy unto the Lord, dedicated to the Word and the
   Spirit of God, to bear fruit of His promise of this day. And you’re not of them! I know that’s
   awful strong, but that’s the Truth just the same. Dedicated to a service in this last days! “Come
   out from amongst it.” 70 Now, “the teaching of Balaam,” not the prophecy of Balaam. That was
   all right. That was God. How many believes that? [Congregation says, “Amen.”—Ed.] The
   prophecy of Balaam was exactly right, ’cause he couldn’t speak nothing else. The anointing of
   God wouldn’t speak nothing else, and God vindicated it by proving it was the Truth. But it was
   “the teaching of Balaam.”

   209 How you going to build your church upon the Rock? How will the preacher ever
   stand in the pulpit and preach the Rock, and build it upon the fundamentals of the full Gospel,
   when his audience, some of his people out there, would put him out? Now, I blame the preacher
   88
   for not having the audacity, and the Spirit of God, for just shutting the door, say, “Get
   somebody else will stand for that stuff and not me.” I—I admire a preacher that would do that.
   210 But woe unto that congregation when an anointed man of God tries to bring them the
   Word, and then they won’t line up with It. That’s right. How is he going to have a church that
   all the nine gifts operating in it, and so forth, and then, they and that, and the church won’t
   even—even live decently and morally, won’t learn their ABC’s of the Gospel? Then say, “If I
   had a better preacher!” Why, it’s your fault. That’s right.

   I WAS THERE THREE YEARS, AND NOT ONE TIME DID YOU INVITE ME TO YOUR
   PULPIT. I SET IN TUCSON FOR NEARLY THREE YEARS. GOD WILL TAKE ME FROM
   THE DESERT ONE OF THESE DAYS. THIS MESSAGE MUST LIVE. I tried my best to get
   in to you. I—I know the reason you did it. You hear? Only reason you did it, your
   denomination would kick you out. And you know, many of you I’ve talked to, there at Furr’s
   Restaurant, and you know it’s the truth. Shame on you. 336 Come out of it. Get out of there,
   brother. If there’s any Life in you, you’ll be like that little eagle I just spoke of, you’ll hear the
   Word of God. Remember, you’re going to hear This for the last time, one of these days. We’re
   real close now. Won’t you come, tonight? 337 Dear God, we set solemnly now, a thanksgiving
   day it really is, Lord. I am grateful, Lord, to be living in this day. This is the greatest day. Paul
   the apostle longed to see this day. The great men of old longed to see it. The prophets longed to
   see it. They looked for this day. Abraham looked for this day, for he sought for a City whose
   Builder and Maker was God; it hangs right above us, tonight. John seen the Spirit of God
   descending out of Heaven, bore record, knowed that that was the Son of God. And, think now,
   He’s choosing His Bride. 338 Dear God, out across the land everywhere, speak to their heart.
   You’re the only One can change their heart. If that wasn’t Seed put in there at the beginning,
   they’ll never see It, Lord. They’re just…“The blind will lead the blind. They’ll fall in the ditch,”
   as sure as anything, because Your Word says they will. 339 Now, Father, being that we see
   across the country, around the world, in Africa, dozens, dozens through South Africa,
   Mozambique, all across the country, little assemblies taking these tapes. And so will this tape go
   to twenty-some odd, different nations. They’re beginning to see It and pull away, hundreds
   and hundreds of them. Won’t take many, Lord. Then when the last member is received into
   the Body, Christ will come. 340 Lord God, I’m asking the Bride, tonight, the ones that I feel
   has pulled away and waiting, may they separate themselves from everything in the world. They
   must lay in the Presence of the warm Son Light of the Son of God, bathing in His Word, in His
   love. Grant it, dear God. 341 May these people here, visible, that held up their hand, tonight,
   dozens of them through this great tabernacle, I pray, God, that new Life will come into them; I
   pray it, for across the nation and even around the world, where the tape will be played, that
   89
   they also will receive this Thanksgiving Message and know, by the hints and things that’s been
   throwed, what they must do. I pray it, Father. Grant it. Bless them. They’re Yours. 342 I know
   it’s customary now, Father, that we ask the people to the altar. And I pray, dear God, that in
   every mission, everywhere around, and in across the world, that they will come to the altar: the
   black, the white, yellow, brown, wherever they are; the rich, the poor, the indifferent, the
   beggars, whatever they are. 343 The denominationals, those who set self-styled and selfcentered, O God, “Naked, miserable, wretched, blind, and don’t even know it.” You said it
   would be that way, and it’s that way. 344 So I pray, Father, that You’ll call every Seed,
   tonight. And everywhere around the world that This may fall, MAY IT CATCH THAT
   LITTLE EAGLE THAT KNOWS THE VOICE OF HIS LORD. Grant it, Lord. I commit them
   to You, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.
   
   ONE DAY YOU WILL REAP WHAT YOU SOWED! My God, when the Trumpet of
   God shall sound and the ministry of Christ goes and preaches to the souls that are in prison.
   Brother, if you have ever heard the message of the Shout of Malachi 4, and you have closed up
   your heart to it, if you women have heard him preach said, “Don’t cut your hair” and they went
   right on cutting it and wearing them ole skin down tight dresses and all them nasty clothes, and
   the preachers won’t tell them the truth and they lie to them about Brother Branham and the
   message of the shout of Malachi 4. They have crossed the line, they have crossed the line to the
   point of no return. And then when the ministry of the Seven Seal comes, it brings revival, setting
   in order of the Bride, filling her with the Holy Ghost. Getting fear into the Bride, judgement to
   Ananias and Sapphire. The fires in the Bride to clean them up now.
   And then when God gets them ready - straightened out, walking in the power of the spirit,
   THEN THE TRUMPET OF GOD SHALL SOUND. AMEN. AND THE DEAD IN CHRIST
   SHALL RISE. AND BROTHER BRANHAM, AND ALL THE PROPHETS, SHALL COME
   HELP THE BRIDE IN THIER MINISTRY. And they will take you into the World Council of
   Churches brother and they’ll try to kill you, but there will be standing the angels of God and the
   dead in Christ around you, and nothing shall harm you, not even the hair on your head will be
   touched.
   Brother, don’t you realize what God’s is doing? He’s all over me, He’s here right now!!!
   How many feel it? I feel him here right now!
   Brother, how can you fear the World Council of Churches? When you’ll walk right in
   there and put your finger right upon them and you’ll not shout until He tells you to shout. The
   Trumpet shall sound and then it will be time to shout. And you’ll shout out from inside, brother.
   Don’t meditate what your gonna say. But don’t you see it coming back to the original! THAT
   OUT OF YOUR BELLY SHALL FLOW RIVERS OF LIVING WATERS. You don’t have to
   be educated, you don’t have to quote every scripture from Genesis to Revelation, but you got
   Him, who is the Word, sitting upon the throne and He will act by his own self, the Word, AND
   HE’LL CREATE. That’s why there will be no interpretation to this brother! It’ll be Christ the
   Capstone Himself speaking out from the top of the pyramid. And it’ll bring judgement upon all
   those… As Brother Branham said that one day you false prophets will reap what you sow, you
   wait and see.

   371 Might be closer than you think it is. It’s got me scared. Oh, I haven’t done enough. Where
   are we at? 372 “Time shall be no more.” He announces that time is over. What happens? What
   happens? Could that be so now, brethren? Seriously think. If it is, then the pyramid is capped by
   the Seven Thunders. 373 You remember the pyramid Message? It’s the Capstone. What did It
   do? The Holy Spirit capped off the individual and seal it, when we added to our faith;
   righteousness, and godliness, and faith, and so forth, and kept adding to it till we got seven
   things. And the seventh one was love, which is God. That’s how He makes the individual, and
   caps him and seals him with the Holy Spirit. 374 Then, if that be so, He’s got seven church
   ages, that He’s had seven mysteries that’s been sounded away, and they fought for, to bring
   back. And now the Headstone comes, to cap off the Church. Does the Thunders mean that, my
   brethren? Sirs, is that where we’re at?
    And there it is, there it is, over in the epistles it said that there we’re false prophets and
   teachers among you, who shall bring in lying heresy Jannes and Jambres, but their folly shall be

   8 Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of

   also was.
   Oh, glory to God! Let me nail this down now. About that time the Bride will be given the
   Voice of God in the midst of the apostate church world, and the false prophets. And it’ll be
   something like this, it’ll be something like this… they’ll say by the Voice of God, they’ll say,
   “That seeing that you have uncounted yourself worthy of eternal life, the real genuine Holy
   Ghost, and have accepted a false substitute that let you cut your hair and wear them skin down
   tight dresses and let you preachers compromise….for a cracker… for all the world and the love
   of the money, popularity, and your Cadillacs, and everything! When you should have drank
   branch water and ate soda crackers, and told the truth to the people. And because you’ve done
   that, and have esteemed yourself not worthy of eternal life, HENCE FORTH WE TURN TO

   159 I wonder if we’re that willing tonight? I wonder if the Pentecostal world is willing, tonight,
   to make that same agreement with God? “Lord God, if it knocks my denomination to pieces, if
   they excommunicate me from the council! I don’t care if they take my fellowship card, and I
   have to lay on my stomach, and drink branch water and eat soda crackers, instead of riding
   around in a big car with a big salary! I don’t care what the price is. That system drove me
   away from You. Take me back again, Lord. I’ll believe Your Word. Revenge my eyes that’s been
   put out. Let me die with it. Amen. Let me die out to my ownself. I don’t care what they say about
   me. I may be bishop, I might be this, that, or the other, I don’t care what they say. Bring back
   the power of the Holy Ghost in my life. I’ve been blinded long enough.” 160 Oh, church, are
   you willing for that? “Let me die with the rest of them. Let my name, as reverend, doctor, or
   whatever it be, perish. O God, just give me again, just send upon me again, that glorious
   Power that fell on the Day of Pentecost; that can meet the challenge of this hour, in the face of
   communism or anything else that rises. Let me die, Lord, with them.” There is a possibility,
   you know.
    The Seventh Seal turns the gospel to the Jews. The Gentile days are finished. And when
   the gospel goes over to the Jews by the witness of the sign of the Messiah, then the rapture will
   take place and the tribulation sets in and the Sixth Seal begins. And that Trumpet sounded the
   gospel to the Jews. And then they the Seven Sabbaths of Pentecost are finished, and the feast of
   the atonement of Christ Jesus has started for the Jews. And then the five foolish virgins, when
   they see the gospel go to the Jews, they see the demonstration of the great Holy Ghost. Glory to
   God! Oh, Hallelujah! They’ll weep and gnash and cry. Many will turn on those ole false prophets

   angel’s message, a trumpet sound; second angel’s, a trumpet sounded, when He sent it out.
   Notice, but when the Seals were announced, they were all in one great, Divine thing, to call out a
   group of people; there was one trumpet sound, and Seven Seals were broke. 176 Notice, “Gather
   His elected Jews from the four parts of the heavens.” 177 He mentioned the six Seals, as we have
   seen, but not the Seventh Seal. He has never said nothing in here about the Seventh Seal,
   nowhere. 178 See, right away, the 32nd verse, turns to parables, of the time of the calling of the
   elected Jews. Now watch here, see. 179 “And He’ll send the angels with a trumpet, and gather
   the Elect from the four corners of heaven.” Now He starts… 180 See, He don’t say nothing
   about the Seventh Seal here. See? He spoke of the Sixth Seal; First, Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth,
   and Sixth. 181 But notice: Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When its branches is yet tender,
   and putteth forth leaves, you know that summer is nigh: So likewise ye, when ye shall see all
   these things, know that it is near, even at the door. 182 That last, that question they asked Him,
   “And what will be the sign of the end of the world?” 183 “When you see these Jews…When you
   see these other things taking place, you know what take place. Now, when you see these Jews…”
   Talking to the Jews! Now watch. What company is He talking to, Gentiles? Jews! Jews! See? 184
   Now He said, “You’ll be hated of all nations for My Name,” and so forth, like. 185 Now,
   “When,” He said, “you see these Jews begin to put forth their buds over yonder,” when that
   Israel begins to turn back, getting into her country. When she gets there, (the Church is ready to
   Rapture), there’s only three and a half years left until the end of the old world, and she goes out
   into chaos, and in comes the Millennium, to the new—new earth. Said, “Even at the door!” Now,
   one thousand years on earth is only one day with God. And three and a half years, what would it
   go to? So many seconds, in God’s time. That’s the reason He said, “It’s at the door.”
    Oh, you say, Brother Bob your beside yourself. Yeah I am! The time of Christ is coming.
   Amen! It’s not my words it’s His words, Amen! You’ll see what I’m telling you. I can’t preach
   no more. Oh, it’s a horrible day, terrible day, can you see that saints? Do you understand the
   message of Brother Branham now? Oh, how you ought to weep and cry for your brothers and
   sisters wondering around from Arizona to here to there, looking for something that’ll never be. It
   ought to just smite your heart with a burden. Oh God, let me die out to myself, Lord let me
   crucify this flesh that I might be able to help those poor people in Arizona. Their waiting for
   something they’ll not see.
   Let’s just bow our heads while sister Priscilla comes. I don’t feel led to preach no more to
   you. This is what I told you that the Lord been speaking to me about for the last few weeks.
   That’s why I’ve not come out of my room for nothing. Oh, God, I’m not hungry enough. I don’t
   fear God enough. I don’t appreciate God enough. I see what God is getting ready to do and I see
   my precious brothers and sisters and minister friends wondering around trying to strain in a act
   swore account. Trying to gather themselves together in Arizona for a tent ministry for Malachi 4.
   They say, wasn’t he supposed to come again? No! “Elias has come already and you
   didn’t know it.” You know what, you know it ought to cause you… It ought to cause us to
   a…My! In desperation to cry out to God. “Lord have mercy upon me, help me Lord.” We ought
   to repent in sack cloth and ashes. Can you see why the five foolish virgins will be weeping and
   wailing? Now you see what Brother Branham was trying to say to you under those Feast of the
   Trumpets? Oh My, saints what an hour we’re living in! And what could happen right now? Any
   day the Seven Thunders may utter their Voice. Be prepared at any time. How many of you’d like
   93
   to say, “Brother Bob, help me to understand, help me to understand this thing your preaching
   about!” And you want me to pray for you right now? Let’s bow our heads.
   Brother Lambert gives closing prayer:
   Oh, Lord God, this great mystery that’s beneath that Seventh Seal, Lord it’s our very life,
   it’s our vision of this hour. It’s our pulse of our heart beat, Lord. It’s our thoughts of our mind,
   the meditation of our heart. Oh God! LORD HAVE MERCY UPON THY PEOPLE and help
   them oh God! Lord help thy people! Send something Lord, send this Seven Thunders, Lord! Let
   it utter it’s Voice, Lord, that we might know Lord, that we might be prepared. That we might be
   filled with thy spirit, that we might glorify thy name upon this earth.
   Lord I’m reminded of a prayer that your prophet prayed, that comes to me now, as he was
   praying, of a testimony of a true witness. Lord, we don’t want to just hand out a little track, Lord
   we don’t want to hand out a little tape. Lord God, we want to be written apostle known and read
   of all men. We want to have Jesus to speak from the throne of our hearts by his own Word, that’s
   a true witness. And Lord you said, you shall send this gospel around the world, this gospel of
   Malachi 4, Lord. The doctrine of the apostles around the world. And Lord, I think of poor
   Brother Jose Lord and all them others, many friends, Jack Moore, and all them many friends of
   Brother Branham that loved him, is trying to do something for God, trying to do a service
   without His will. God what weeping and gnashing of teeth when they see this masterpiece that
   Brother Branham come. How they made fun of Brother Branham saying, your ruining your
   ministry. Don’t pick on them women that way, your ruining your ministry.
   BUT OH GOD! When they see this Masterpiece, Mrs. Jesus, come out and manifest the
   power of God, the spirit that came upon Elijah comes upon us Lord. When they see it Lord, and
   it calls the children out of them denominations, and then the ones that they compromised to keep
   their churches full of them converts, God will call them out and they’ll weep and wail. Oh,
   Master God! Lord, we’re so privileged to see these great things Lord and many others are
   blinded to it. But oh, how we praise you! Lord, we’re not saying this to a make ourselves
   something, but it’s you Lord. And Lord, we want this in our heart that we might be able to help
   them oh God! Have mercy upon your children, Lord and send this to help them Father. Lord,
   won’t you help us, if there’s any one here that don’t understand this, this morning, please help
   them, God. Open up their understanding and give them a Revelation. We ask it in Jesus Christ’s
   mighty name. Amen!
    Just a minute now, Sister Betty Payne just gave me this for a witness for my little
   message here this morning. Brother Jose magazine. (Reading;) “God given ministries, versa
   counterfeits.” See how God does things. Sister Betty brought this, this morning and opened it up
   to me. I looked in there and felt the spirit come upon me. That’s what I was preaching about this
   morning. A witness right there of what I preached to you this morning. See that? There God
   comes in the Seven Seal mystery, the sound of the Trumpets to the souls that’re in prison. These
   are counterfeits of his ministry! He calls all his children out of there. Then they’ll weep and wail
   and gnash their teeth. Oh, poor brother Jose, what’s he gonna do when he sees that. I think if we
   don’t get with it right now, it’ll be too late - your tribulation bound. Can you see it saints? Say,
   amen! (Amen) How many want to just stay so faithful to Christ, just line up with that Word of
   God? Let me see your hands. Every hand in here, God bless every one of them. God bless you;
   the kingdoms of this world are gonna become yours pretty soon. Amen

    What a friend we have in Jesus, what page is that? Page 44. Let’s just sing a hymn.
    You say, “Brother Bob, when can we look for this?” I don’t know! Maybe next week, next
   month, (“Wait on God” a brother says) that’s right brother! They that wait upon the Lord. And
   through faith and patience for this we will inherit. In the meantime, Love one another! Love one
   another. Love covereth a multitude of sins. Amen

    It certainly is a pleasure, to be out here in this local assembly in this area. Whether there be
   another assembly even in another area around here, I don’t know about it. We know that the
   local assembly is the Lord Jesus Christ’s preaches the word! Amen! And any assembly that
   claims to be the assembly of the Lord Jesus Christ and isn’t preaching the word…I’ll be like the
   Apostle Paul; I’ll be firm to say that it isn’t the assembly of the Lord Jesus Christ.
    We know that many denominations claim to be that assembly. And we find out, that they will
   not preach the word.
    So, we’re thankful to be here this morning, and gather around this evening light message of
   the word of God. And we’d like to welcome you to our little humble assembly on Still Hill Road.
   We don’t have no building program, we don’t have nothing to join, we don’t have no creed, but
   we do have Jesus Christ in our midst. We do have his word and we’re waiting for the hour of the
   soon appearing of the Lord Jesus Christ in our midst, to take us to our heavenly home. This is
   just our temporary home down here, a temporary dwelling place.
    And we’re trying to prove ourselves that we are Christians down here upon earth. This is a
   proving ground, to prove whether or not you really appreciate Jesus Christ. To prove whether or
   not your desire is to be in that new heavenly home, that’s coming down out of heaven from God.
   I wish he would come down today. But if it don’t come down today, I’ll be looking for it
   tomorrow. For I’m truly looking for that city coming down from heaven, that we may dwell in it
   forever and ever.
    We have a little…Let me read this here. Sister Betty ask prayer for Darla as she is sick with
   fever and vomiting and Sister Bates also needs prayer. Yes, and my little girl’s sick this morning.
   So, let’s just bow our heads in a word of prayer.
   Opening prayer by Brother Lambert:
    Our gracious heavenly father, we thank you Lord Jesus that we can come to you as our God
   and father this morning Lord. Knowing that Lord God “if we walk in the light as you’re in the
   light we have fellowship one with another. And the Blood of Jesus Christ thy son cleanses us
   from all sin.”
   1 John 1:7-Reference quote:
   7 But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the
   blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.
    Now Lord, we stand before you perfect this morning, perfect and sinless Lord. And so, Lord
   we come boldly before the throne of Grace. And Heavenly Father we send out our little prayer to
   you this morning Lord, for this precious one that mentioned in this request Father this little baby
   of sister Betty’s Lord. Heavenly Father how we pray God right now, in the name of the Lord
   
   2
   Jesus that you will heal this little baby according to your word Lord. And Heavenly Father, we
   pray for sister Bates Lord. Lord she’s not a young woman any more, and she’s up in years and
   she’s working and trying to meet the needs of her family Father. Lord we send out a prayer for
   that dear saint this morning. Father God strengthen her Lord, heal her and raise her up and give
   her strength to serve you. Now Lord we pray that you’d bless our hungry hearts this morning
   with your word. Help us to feel the quickening of the Holy Ghost in our midst. Help us Lord to
   line up with thy word in this hour. Bless every one, under the sound of my voice this morning.
   Lord and how we pray that we may go out of these doors here this morning in this little basement
   Lord, better Christians and better equipped that we might serve you better Lord. Realizing that
   the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ and appearing to catch his waiting Bride away, maybe any
   day now. So, Lord with fear and trembling in our hearts, we pray help us Lord. In Jesus name,
   amen.
    I’ve been kinda negligent in some of the church business here. I just kinda…Well, not too
   smart of a fella anyway, and I forget these things. But I, meant to call sister Diana. I don’t
   know… well I just kinda a… Been kinda failing to kinda ask sister Diane if she wouldn’t feel
   lead of the Lord Jesus to…I know she talented in book work, to kinda to do our little church
   business here. But I know she works and know that might be kinda of a hard thing to ask but, if
   sister Diane would feel like that, she would like to do that for the Lord Jesus. I don’t believe we
   can do anything for God, that he don’t see it.
    I remember one time, a woman was backslidden from the Lord and lying in the hospital dying
   with cancer. And she called Brother Branham to come down and pray for her. Brother Branham
   got down to the hospital and went in and she lying there dying with cancer, and the Lord God
   spoke and said, “Because you give a dress to my prophet’s wife when she was a little ragged
   girl” God healed her. “Thus, saith the Lord, your healed” See! One little dress, see.
    Now you can’t…I don’t care how little of a thing you do, if you do it for the Lord Jesus
   Christ, he’ll never forget it, Never! And if we could only get a revelation of that, where God said,
   “If you would give a glass of water to the least one of these of my elected in the Bride, ye shall
   in no wise lose your reward.”
   Matthew 10:42-Reference quote:
   42 And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the
   name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward.
   And when that great day appears at the great white throne judgement and when those foolish
   virgins come forth and many that weren’t foolish virgins. Maybe they didn’t profess anything in
   the Lord Jesus, but has given, even to a glass of water to the elected will be given eternal life.
   Now, you think of that! Think of it! That would be given eternal life, even for a glass of water.
    Now, if that might stumble somebody, I’d like to call your attention to the scriptures. That
   said at the great white throne judgement, that there was to classes of people there. There was the
   Bride and there was the second resurrection people. The Bride was sitting in the throne of
   judgement with Christ. Amen? (Amen) And he said to those… said to those out in front of him,
   “Lord when did we see thee hungry? When did we see thee naked and didn’t clothed thee and
   hungry and didn’t feed thee? When, Lord? I don’t remember that, when was that?” And he
   turned around and pointed to one of them people in the Bride, He said, “Remember that time you
   invited them over for dinner? Remember that time you gave them that little offering? Remember
   that time they was running from the persecution of the world council of churches and you took
   
   3
   them into your home, let them stay all night before they left the city fleeing from the
   persecution? Amen! And as much as you did it unto these you did it unto me. Now enter into
   Eternal Life. You didn’t have it, but I give it to you!” Enter into Eternal life.
   Matthew 25:31-46-Reference quote:
   31 When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he
   sit upon the throne of his glory:
   32 And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another,
   as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats:
   33 And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.
   34 Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit
   the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:
   35 For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a
   stranger, and ye took me in:
   36 Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto
   me.
   37 Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed
   thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink?
   38 When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee?
   39 Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?
   40 And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have
   done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.
   41 Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into
   everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:
   42 For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink:
   43 I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison,
   and ye visited me not.
   44 Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a
   stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?
   45 Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of
   the least of these, ye did it not to me.
   46 And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.
    Don’t let me hide my money in the bank. Don’t let me fail to be hospitable brother.
   I tell you, an ole bum come to my door not too long ago. Dirty and nasty and filthy and we was
   just getting ready to sit down to dinner. Oh, he was a terrible site. He looked up at me and his
   face was all burnt from the cold, laying out in the cold and his nose all red and eyes and dirty. I
   said, “How do you do sir!” And he said, “Sir I’m hungry, could I rack your lawn for something
   to eat?” And I said, “No sir, but you can come in and have dinner with us.” He come in and he
   said, “Sir, I’m…I don’t want to sit down here. Give me something and I’ll eat outside.” I said,
   “No you are perfectly welcome to eat at our table. We don’t feed people outside, we feed them at
   the table.” So, I said, “If you’d like to go in and wash up.” He went in the bathroom and washed
   up and he got kinda nervous. He sure did like them pinto beans, my wife fixed, with ham hocks
   in them and cornbread. He sure did like that. And then we sent him on his way.

    Well to me you know, as far as I know that could of been Jesus Christ, for all I know. See, I
   don’t know. And that’s why the Bible said, to be hospitable. I don’t know who’s the Bride and
   who isn’t the Bride.
    And the Bible said, beware least ye entertain strangers unaware that’s angels. Amen!
   Hebrews 13:2-Reference quote:
   2 Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.
    So, brother whether you realize it or not, your being tested every minute every hour of the
   day. Did you know that? Oh, help us! We’ll get into the word this morning. Not to fail our test
   and to be found faithful.
    I’d like to speak to you this morning on…I’ve been kinda waiting to preach this little message
   to you, on “Broken Fellowship.” And if you’ll open your bibles to:
   Philippians 3:1-10-Reading
   10 That I may know him…That’s the apostle Paul speaking… and the power of his resurrection,
   and the fellowship of his sufferings”
    Wait just a minute here, let’s… I wanna start reading of here a little bit. Let’s just read it all,
   its God word and I love it.
   Philippians 3:1-11-Reading:
   3 Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you, to me indeed is not
   grievous, but for you it is safe.
   2 Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision.
   3 For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and
   have no confidence in the flesh.
   4 Though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other man thinketh that he hath
   whereof he might trust in the flesh, I more:
   5 Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of the
   Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee;
   6 Concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the righteousness which is in the law,
   blameless.
   7 But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ.
   8 Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus
   my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may
   win Christ,
   9 And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is
   through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith:
   10 That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings,
   being made conformable unto his death;
   11 If by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead.
   
   5
    God add a blessing to his word. Now over in first John 1 and 3.
   1 John 1:3-Reading:
   3 That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with
   us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.
   4 And these things write we unto you, that your joy may be full.
   5 This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is light,
   and in him is no darkness at all.
   6 If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth:
   7 But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the
   blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.”
    Think of it! The blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses us from all sin. “Broken Fellowship”
   The entire plan of redemption heads up in this one word, “Fellowship.”
    It’s been heard we’ve said that fellowship means to men in a ship, having fellowship. But in
   the Webster’s Dictionary we find that fellowship means; companionship, friendly association, a
   mutual sharing, and a group of people with the same interest.
    And I think that’s why we’re here this morning. We’re a group of people that have the same
   interest. And that is the word of God and the blood of Jesus Christ and the plan of redemption.
   And the hope of the resurrection of the dead and eternal life, never to die. And this makes us
   have something in common, a group with the same interest.
    And we are mutual and we’re together in this thing as heirs of the Lord Jesus Christ. We have
   a mutual sharing of all that God give to Christ, we have inherited that and that’s why we’re here
   this morning. But we have a beautiful fellowship and that is in the plan of redemption.
   Endnote:
   55-0223 - Job
   William Marrion Branham
   Now, Adam in the garden of Eden, when he first sinned, God had a way of redemption for
   him, right quick, just as soon as he sinned. God made a way of redemption. And before Adam
   could ever approach back to fellowship with the Father, God had to slay an innocent lamb, or
   sheep, and make him a cloth to go around him, and throw out the welcome carpet for Adam to
   walk back on the carpet of redemption, to come into His Presence again. God always had a
   plan of redemption, and that’s been through blood, ever since the very beginning and dawn of
   time, perceived in the mind of God, before the world ever come into existence.
   
    Now we find out, take a family of husband and wife and children…The reason that a man and
   woman marry is because that they desire fellowship with one another. So therefore, they legally
   get married and they have fellowship. And then because of this fellowship there is born into this
   holy union of fellowship of husband and wife, the fruit of their fellowship. And this little family
   unit if they continue in fellowship the husband and wife, the mother and father… If they
   continue in fellowship with one another then there is a beautiful thing to see father and mother…
   Is, that right? (Amen)
   
   6
    Husband and wife and brothers and sisters all working together as a little family unit. Happy
   joyful, going on their picnics together and kneeling around the family alter in prayer. When one
   suffers, they, all suffer, when ones happy they’re all happy, when ones sad they’re all sad.
    You take how sad it is though, when daddy begins to go down to the bars and spend his time
   down at the bars and start fellowshipping with all the boys down to the neighborhood bar. Then
   the next thing you know, instead of a beautiful fellowship… If that continues, we then have a
   broken fellowship. And there that little family unit goes into sorrow and disaster. The father and
   the mother are separated and the children one goes to this home and one goes to the other home.
   Then there is embedded upon their minds a tragedy that they carry to the grave.
    And if that beautiful fellowship of husband and wife is broken, it could be broken in many
   ways. You take just one harsh word, one harsh word from the husband automatically breaks your
   fellowship with one another. Then you may have to go to work that day and everything goes
   wrong that day. Because of your broken fellowship that morning when you got up. Just one harsh
   word, one wrong word can break that fellowship.
    And that’s just like it was in the Garden of Eden. God before the foundation of the world,
   when he wasn’t even God. But he was Elohim the almighty all self-existing one. But in that great
   spirit of Elohim, was a desire to have fellowship with sons and daughters of God. And there as
   he drew up his great plan, in his great mind.
    There he put his son, his first son Adam in a beautiful garden that he created for him, called
   the Garden of Eden. And there God begin his great plan of fellowship. And he told his son, that
   he created him a help mate for him, Eve. And he told them that we’ll have beautiful fellowship
   together as long as you don’t eat of this tree of knowledge. Is, that right? (Amen)You may eat of
   all these other trees, but don’t eat of this tree.
    There he fortified his son that he was to have fellowship with him behind his word. Oh, how
   beautiful it was, how God Elohim came down and walked in that garden and there he had
   fellowship with Adam. Adam and God, we’re one.
    Eve could say, “Adam I want you to make me and put me a beautiful banana tree right over
   here. I’d like to have this banana tree over here” And Adam could say, “Sure honey,” He say,
   “Be thou banana tree be planted over here.” There would be a beautiful banana tree. Oh, how
   wonderful it was, that whatever they desired it was all right there for them.
    All Adam had to do… He had such a fellowship with his maker that he could just speak the
   word and there it was. And oh, how God loved that! How he loved to come down in the cool of
   the evening in the Garden of Eden and talk to his son and have fellowship with him.
    God loves fellowship. He wanted fellowship before the foundation of the world. When he
   created angels, it just wasn’t the kind of fellowship that he wanted. He desired a better fellowship
   than that. So, when he created Adam, that was a great fellowship a better fellowship than he had
   with the angels, because Adam could appreciate him more.
    But oh, Gods great plan, there Satan fell into Gods great plan in the Garden of Eden. And he
   deceived Eve into doing a wicked thing. He brought Eve out from behind the protection of Gods
   word. And caused the beast the creation that was next to man, to commit adultery. There they
   committed adultery and there it broke fellowship between Eve and her husband. Is, that right?
   Broke fellowship between Eve and her husband.
    But oh, what a sad day that was, when the news reached heaven, of what his son Adam had
   done.
    Brother, Adam had the title deed to heaven and earth. And he was like a God upon the earth.
   And there when Adam walked out from behind the fortification of God’s word, he knew that
   
   7
   God told him not to do that! And as long as he stayed behind God’s word he could talk with God
   and he could be as God. Is, that right? He was a boss of all the earth, whatever Adam said it was
   so. Whatever Adam spoke, it was done, God created it right before his eyes. Is, that right? But oh
   my, when Adam walked out from behind Gods word and partook of the thing that God told him
   not to do, there he broke fellowship with his creator.
    And God came down in the Garden of Eden in the evening time for fellowship with Adam.
   And he come down and said, “Adam where art thou?” It’s time for fellowship! And he couldn’t
   find Adam nowhere. “Adam where art thou?”
   Genesis 3:9-Reference quote:
   9 And the Lord God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art thou?
   10 And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid
   myself.
   11 And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I
   commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?
   
   And so, Adam knew that God knew where he was at. He called out from behind the bushes and
   said, “He I am, over here Lord.” God said, “Son what are you doing over there?” Adam said, I’m
   naked!” He said, “Who told you that you was naked? Have you eat of the fruit that I commanded
   you not to eat? Oh my! Fellowship was there broken. And he said, “Adam because thou hast
   done this our fellowship is broken, you’re gonna be drove out of this beautiful garden. No more
   can you speak the word, no more will you have power and authority to speak the word and create
   and do all these wonderful things that I’ve given you. Because you disobeyed my word, you
   come out from behind my word. And there he put a curse upon the woman, and said, “Your
   desire shall be to thy husband all the days of thy life.” Amen? (Amen)
    Not until the holy ghost fell at Azusa street in California, no! He shall thy desire shall be to
   thy husband all the days of thy life and thy husband shall rule over thee.

   22 Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.
    Now, I don’t mean that a wife is to used as a door mat! And I don’t mean that a man is to just
   misuse his wife, but a husband and wife is supposed to have a beautiful fellowship.
    And I tell you, the women in this hour need to find their place in this fellowship.
   In order for God to bless husband and wife, in order for God to bless the assembly the women
   and the men need to find their place. Need to find their place. God told the woman that she was
   to be in subjection to her husband in all things. In the book of Titus said, let the woman be in
   subjection to her husband in all things that the word of God be not blasphemed.

   begins to cut her hair off, did you know that long hair is a Token that you believe in Geneses

   don’t believe God.

   participle passive of shear.
   1. Cut off; as a lock of wool shorn.
   2. Having the hair or wool cut off or sheared; as a shorn lamb.
   3. Deprived; as a prince shorn of his honors.
    God put a curse upon a woman, said that she would have pain in child birth. That she would
   have pain in child birth because she got us into all this death, she caused all this trouble that’s in

   And that why God said, “That the woman to be un subjection to the husband in all things that
   the word of God be not blasphemed.”
    How many blasphemers are there out in the world today? Think of it. No wonder God said,
   for the woman to be meek and quiet, perfecting a meek and quiet spirit, which is precious in the
   site of the Lord.
   1 Peter 3:4-5-Reference quote:
   4 But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of
   a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.
   5 For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned
   themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands:
    In order for God to bless the home, in order for God to bless the church, to bless the
   assemblies, we have to find our positions in Christ. Amen.
   Oh, you say, “I don’t believe that!” Brother it’s from Genesis’s to Revelation. That’s why Paul
   said, “I suffer not a woman to teach or to “usurp authority,” because he could only say what
   God said in Genesis 3:15-(1Timothy 2:12)

    Oh God, this world is so hell bound. Listen if it was total insanity for a grandmother to walk
   outside with a nasty pair of shorts on, brother what is it today? If they locked them up in an
   insane asylum back there fifty years ago, thirty-five years ago even. It was insanity for a woman
   to cut her hair back there. You never seen women cut their hair back in the olden days.
    You know what? I’m only thirty-five years old, in my home town of Kenova West Virginia if
   a woman wore high-heel shoes, if a woman wore red high-heel shoes that just come out, that was
   just made by Satan himself. That’s right! Why does a woman want to wear a high heel show
   anyway? I want to ask you that.

   Today… Listen. I believe that God is going to call a people out of the Gentiles for His Name in
   this great latter movement here of a revival sweeping the nation. And if the holiness people don’t
   want it, He will raise it up out of something else. That’s right. It’s got to be. It’s got to come.
   He’s able of these stones to rise children unto Abraham. What’s the matter? We’ve let down
   the bars, compromising. An old minister used to sing: We let down the bars, We compromised
   with sin; We let down the bars, The sheep got out; How did the goats get in? You let down the
   bars (That’s what it is.), LET DOWN ON THE WORD. We’re getting stiff and starchy, afraid
   to come back to the old fashion Gospel (That’s right), to the old salvation that makes you
   clean up, fix up (That’s right), make right and come before God. 25 That’s what’s the matter
   with the church today. We need a revival. We don’t need a new seminary. We don’t need new
   preachers. We don’t need new church buildings. We need a revival in what we got. That’s what it
   is. Stirring up… Amen. All right. I’m not amening myself, but “Amen” means “so be it.” And I
   believe it with all my heart. That’s what the world needs today is an old fashion, God sent, skyblue, sin-killing religion, old Saint Paul’s revival, and the Bible Holy Ghost back into the
   church again. That might be pretty strong for a Baptist, but that’s right. True. I’m a Pentecostal
   Baptist. I got the Holy Ghost since I’ve been a Baptist. That’s right. Notice, Cleans up, sets
   aside. Makes a different person, new creature in Christ Jesus. All right. Here’s what we need. 26
   Then he doubted it to be so. But God’s going to confirm His Word. Don’t you worry. “God’s
   able of these stones to rise children to Abraham,” said John.
   
    Brother, the women back in my home town, if a woman cut her hair and she had on high-heel

   of town. I remember them woman in my town, everybody knew them. They was branded as a
   whore. Oh, God!
    And women get up in the churches and scream and cry and speak in tongues and try to praise
   God. And God looks down upon them as an unclean prostitute, when they cut their hair, they got
   
   11
   a curse on them. Until, I believe you can repent. Sure, you can repent and then God will forgive
   you for it. But you let that hair grow out. I tell you, there won’t be no short hair in the bride.
   There won’t be no women cutting their hair in heaven, Glory to God. There will be no short
   dresses in heaven. Glory to God.

   56-0610 - Perfection
   William Marrion Branham
   106 The word conscience, in the right interpretation that we would use here. This is the King
   James version. In England, it means a conscience. In here, it would mean “the desire.” “The
   worshipper once purged,” by the purgative of Christ at the Calvary, “has no more desire of sin.
   Old things has passed away; all things have become new.” 107 Now, you can sing like a lark,
   and still have hatred, malice and strife in your body, in your soul. You can shout like I don’t
   know what, you still have it. You can dance in the Spirit, you could speak with tongues, you can
   prophesy, you can preach, any of those things, and still have malice, envy, strife in your heart.
   108 But when the real, true foreordination of God’s Eternal Word, when your name was
   written there, and the Blood ever purges that person; the very thoughts of it, condemn him on
   the tracks where he is standing at. 109 Said, “Don’t condemn me. I go these places; I don’t
   condemn me.” Why doesn’t it? You, as a negative worshipper, has never been purged by the
   Blood of Jesus Christ. 110 And the legalists got a hold of this idea, “Hallelujah, I’ll wear my
   dresses down this way, and my dresses down this way. I’ll let my hair grow long, and I’ll be all
   right.” That’s a lie. And they point back to the woman with short hair, and with short dresses,
   say, “She’s going to hell.” I can’t say that. But I think those things are all right. I’m not
   condemning them. But when you rest your Eternal hopes and salvation upon that doctrine, you
   are damned with it. 111 The man or a woman, it doesn’t matter whether you’re this, that, or
   the other, you come to the fountain filled with Blood drawn from Emmanuel’s veins, and let
   the purgative of the Blood of the Lord Jesus Christ purge your sins. 112 Brother, it won’t
   matter, you can still have dresses so long, you could still not wear a short-sleeve shirt, you
   men, and those things, or whatever you want to; but if you still got malice, and envy and strife.
   You might have run, danced, spoke in tongues, shouted, preached the Gospel, or anything, but
   you’re lost until that Blood has cleansed you and set in the Divine love of the Lord Jesus
   Christ, in your heart, and leaving the Life prints of Christ behind you. Amen. 113 “Where
   there is tongues, they shall cease. Where there is prophecy, it shall fail. Where there is
   knowledge, it shall be vanished. But when that which is perfect is come, that which is in part is
   done away.” 114 And we’re resting today, as legalists, upon some legal thing that we done. Why,
   when I was a sinner, I was a leopard. The more I tried to quit this and quit that, I only made my
   spots brighter. I was a hypocrite with it, and so was you. BUT THE DAY WHEN YOU COME
   TO CALVARY, TO THE PURGING, WHERE THE REAL LAMB… 115 Under the Old
   Testament, they brought a lamb. They would go out and commit adultery. They would get mad,
   and fuss, and fight, and cuss. And, when they did, they’d bring a lamb, bring it to the priest, say,
   “Oh, priest of God!” “Yes?” 116 “I cursed my neighbor. I—I committed adultery. I told a lie. I
   stole.” Lay his hands upon this dying lamb, without a spot. The priest examined it; had to be
   kept up, to see if it was right. Laid his hands upon it, and they cut the throat. And the blood
   went up over his hands, and the little lamb bleating, kicking, and dying. 117 And the
   worshipper standing there, said, “Yes, that should be me, but the lamb is taking my place.” But
   
   12
   he went back out with the same desire. He would do it again just as soon as he got a chance. 118
   And that’s the way people do today. They come in and confess, and say, “I’ve this, that, or the
   other,” and go back out; and turn around, do the same thing over again. Join one church,
   another; if this one gets a little something started, well, go to this one and that one. 119 But
   what was it the shadow of? It was imperfect. That could never take away sin, but it was a
   shadow of the real double cure coming. 120 And when Jesus Christ the Son of God came, and
   died at Calvary, and the worshipper once places his hands upon the head of the Lord Jesus,
   and knowing that the screaming and crying at the cross, that death, that vicarious suffering,
   he ought to pay it hisself, in that depths of hell where he should have went. He knowed that
   Christ paid the place of confessing his sin.
   
    How many has broken their fellowship with God. How many have broken their fellowship
   with God, when you come from out behind the word of God woman and you wear them highheel shoes.
    Why did Satan create them high-heel shoes? The holy ghost told me one day, “Why, did
   Satan make them high-heel shoes son?” I looked at them and I said, “Well Lord I can see it! It
   was make their calf come up so their leg would be pretty.” Amen! And I tell you, any saint of
   God that’s filled with the holy ghost, she’ll throw away those high-heel shoes and get some
   decent shoes on.
    Oh, you say when preachers hear you preaching like that, they say, “Brother Bob your
   preaching a catalog religion.” You can say anything that you want to. But I know what God
   wants preached. Amen! And I’m not about to change, I ain’t about to change and I never will
   change. It’s holiness hell fire and brimstone as far as I’m concerned.
    Listen! God said, “He gave apostles and prophets in his church. He gave a five-fold ministry
   in his church to keep his church clean. And that’s just what’s the matter now is that church is
   filled with skin down tight dresses and high-heel shoes and short hair. Is because there’s no God

   31 And God has made a promise, “If the people that are called by My Name shall assemble
   themselves together and pray, then I’ll hear from Heaven.” 32 And so we, tonight, want to think
   on that. And remember, that, in the midst of all this cry, God cannot send a revival till He’s got
   men in shape to take it. We cannot have a revival until we get men, God-called men, Godtrained men, that’s not trained up in the schools of theology and of education, but rugged men
   of faith, that God has brought up in the school of His rugged training. Men who are not afraid
   to face the fire! Men who has come in the Presence of God; and knows His power, and knows
   His omnipotence, and knows His healing power! Some men that’s trained to know the living
   God! It’s all right to train them by the Word, but, “The letter killeth; the Spirit giveth Life.” 33
   And before we can have this revival, God has to call out and train men, God-trained men, to
   carry this Message. And they don’t care what the opposition is. They are willing to go to the
   fiery furnace in defeat, or to the lions’ den, or wherever it may be. They’re ready to go,

   64-1221 - Why It Had To Be Shepherd
   William Marrion Branham
   The great Prophet-Shepherd had brought them the Message, and they were delivered, the
   Prophet-Shepherd. No matter what the other ecclesiastical realms said about It, they knew what
   had happened. Just as them shepherds did back there, they knowed what took place. 184 NO
   MAN HAS A RIGHT TO ENTER THE SACRED DESK TO PREACH THE WORD UNTIL
   HE HAS DID AS MOSES DID, MEET GOD, HIMSELF, upon grounds where that there’s no
   theologian can explain It away. Moses was there! No matter how Israel’s messengers said, “oh,
   it was a nonsense, you just imagined you saw this; it’s nonsense,” YOU COULDN’T TAKE
   THAT AWAY FROM HIM, HE KNOWED! HE WAS THERE! HE WAS THE ONE IT
   HAPPENED TO! AND NO MAN BY A—A THEOLOGICAL DEGREE OR SOME
   DOCTOR’S DEGREE HAS A RIGHT BEHIND THE PULPIT, TO CLAIM THE MESSAGE
   OF JESUS CHRIST, UNTIL HE’S FIRST MET GOD FACE TO FACE IN THE PILLAR
   OF FIRE. HE HAS NO RIGHT TO CALL HIMSELF A MESSENGER, ’cause all the
   theologians in the world couldn’t explain That away from you. It happened to you! You were
   there, you know about It. Care what anybody else says, or how much they can say, “the days is
   gone, it isn’t so,” you…it happened to you, and it’s according to the Word. 185 YES, THAT’S
   THE REASON MOSES KNEW THIS VOICE HAD SPOKE TO HIM, WAS A WORD
   VOICE. He knowed that God had told Abraham, “Your seed shall sojourn for four hundred
   years, but I will deliver them.” And he knowed the four hundred years was up and he was called
   to do it. 186 MAN AND WOMEN, GOD PROMISED IN THIS LAST DAYS THAT HE’D
   POUR OUT HIS SPIRIT UPON ALL FLESH. HE PROMISED HE’D SEND THE
   BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST, AND HE’D CALL A BRIDE WITHOUT SPOT OR
   WRINKLE. HE PROMISED TO DO IT, HE’LL DO IT. DON’T LISTEN TO THESE
   HIRELING SHEPHERDS, THEY’LL LEAD YOU ASTRAY. The Holy Spirit is the Shepherd
   to feed you sheep food from this Word. IT ALWAYS COMES BY THE SHEPHERD. HE IS
   OUR SHEPHERD. LISTEN TO HIM, YOU ARE THE SHEEP OF HIS FOLD; IF YOU
   ARE, YOU HEAR HIS VOICE. NOT WHAT SOMEBODY ELSE SAYS, YOU HEAR WHAT
   HE SAYS. A STRANGE VOICE, YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT. 187 Oh, my, listen to
   the mighty shepherd-prophet again, interpreting and introducing to them, John (when he
   stood in the river of Jordan), look what he said (was standing there, preaching), he said, “The
   hour is coming…”
    And the prophet of God had a vison saw a woman wearing them high heel shoes that pulled
   their calf up to make her leg pretty, she couldn’t walk that straight narrow way to heaven, she fell
   
   14
   off. How many heard the prophet say that and go right on waring them though? They go right on
   waring them. I don’t care about it, I don’t care about it! It don’t bother me if you cut your hair
   and ware them dresses, but God cares. He said, not to do it. You talk about it with God. Oh, God!

   65-0418M - It Is The Rising Of The Sun
   William Marrion Branham
   232 My own mother, she’s gone on now, and she was a very odd woman. And she was, you know,
   about a half Indian, and she was odd. But in there she was a person that didn’t dream. But I
   don’t think…She only had four or five dreams, all of her life. But every time she dreamed a
   dream, it was true. She had a dream, it was true. 233 I remember one time when I first started
   preaching, many years ago. We was living right up here on the road, right just above here. I was
   preaching right here at this church. And she dreamed a dream, that I was standing here by the
   side of three steps. And I was standing, preaching to everybody, that they must walk up these
   three steps before they hit the highway. And on the highway is a little pearly-like white line, run
   right into the—the—the doors of Heaven, to the pearly gate. And that pearl had been stretched
   out to the top of these steps. If that ain’t my Message exactly today; justification,
   sanctification, the baptism of the Holy Ghost! And I was saying that a person has to come by
   these three steps, to be able to walk that highway. And said that… 234 There was a lady came
   by. Now, you know what kind of shoes people wore thirty-five years ago. There was a lady come
   by, had on a great big pair like they wear today, spike-heeled shoes. And she come by. And I
   said, “Wait a minute, sister. You can’t walk that highway with that.” And I said, “You—you, you
   can’t do that.” 235 And she said, “Ah!” She said, looked around at the rest of the women, said,
   “Don’t believe him. He’s a madman. See? Don’t believe him. I’ll show you I can be justified,
   sanctified, and filled with the Holy Ghost, and still walk that.” And she…I just let her go.
   Couldn’t do no more about it, couldn’t stop her. And she jumped up on the highway. And she
   looked back at the sister, said, “See, I told you!” She started to run up, and she… 236 You know,
   as the Bible said, in Isaiah, 5th chapter, that they would have “outstretched necks.” They have
   to; they’re pitched over, see. “Mincing as…” They have to, have to twist, “Mincing as they go,
   making a tinkling with their heels; see, the daughters of Zion in the last day.” 237 And she
   started up that highway, just as hard as she could run. And, after a while, the road got narrower
   and narrower. She started reeling, mincing like that, and off she went. 238 And mother said,
   “The horriblest screams that I ever heard in my life, was that woman falling into those flames
   and smoke, going down, down like that.” Said, I “turned around and said, ‘See?’” 239 She
   just obeyed everything but one Word, see, everything but one Word. Sure, Pentecostal women
   can be saved, sanctified, and filled with the Holy Ghost, and then fail. Absolutely. “Man shall
   not live by bread alone, but by every Word that proceeds.” See? See? And she failed It. And as I
   said, see, she would have went on in, all right, but, see, she failed to listen; telling her what was
   ahead. And He’s wrote the Gospel by the disciples, apostles, and Doctrine of the apostles and
   prophets, and so forth, and they won’t listen.
    Oh God! When I think how Adam, came out from being fortified behind the word, and broke
   that beautiful fellowship that he had. Amen, broke that beautiful fellowship that he had, that Eve
   broke her fellowship that she had. She had to come and tell Adam that she went up and had this
   affair with this big beautiful beast in the Garden.
   
   15
    Yeah, you’re a beast! Did you know you we’re a beast? BROTHER, YOU WAS A
   NATURAL BORN SLOPPIN, DIRTY FILTHY BEAST UNTIL THE GRACE OF GOD
   COME INTO YOUR HEART. You laid down there to them ole beer joints and prostitute
   houses, you men did in the army, didn’t you? Sloppin and drinkin around, why? Because you
   was a beast. Is, that right? (Amen)
    But oh, when the grace of God come down! My God, he tamed that beast nature in you and
   put the nature of a man of God inside of you. And now because of the union and fellowship with
   Jesus Christ, you love holiness and righteousness and the things of God.
    I tell you when you see a woman that still cuts her hair and still wares high-heel shoes and
   them skin down tight dresses, God will judge you for it on the judgement day! Don’t think he
   won’t! He’ll judge them for it. It proves that their nature hasn’t been changed yet.
    That’s the thing about it brother. I know this is not algebra, no this is not algebra but it’s the
   ABC’s of the gospel of Jesus Christ. If you can’t do the ABC’s of the gospel, you’ll never be
   able to work an algebra problem. Oh God, how we need to get people that will just line up with
   the ABC’s of the gospel.

   62-0127 - Meanest Man I Know
   William Marrion Branham
   And when God kisses us welcome into His Kingdom, we’re home. It’s all right. It’s all over then.
   We’ve been washed by the preparation that He prepared for us: His Blood, a sweet smelling
   savour, perfumed by the sanctification that drives the stink of the world off (Hallelujah. I feel
   kind of religious right now.), taking away the stink of the world, or the desires of the world. See,
   if the world’s still in us then there’s something wrong. No wonder we can’t have a real
   Pentecostal revival. No wonder there’s something missing. The guest hasn’t exactly entered
   right. You see, Jesus taught that one time about the robes, and He said, “This man was found
   there not prepared, and he was bound and cast in outer darkness.” So much could be said on it.
   47 But that’s the way they did it. Then they were home, they felt like they were a brother. You
   can’t feel like you’re a brother when you still desire the world. You can’t associate yourself
   out here in things of the world of cheating, lying, stealing, you women bobbing off your hair
   and wearing shorts and everything, then still feel at home when the Word of God’s being
   preached. You’re supposed to be Pentecostal, supposed to be filled with the Holy Ghost.
   Someone hit at me not long ago, said, “Why don’t you leave them people alone?” Said,
   “People think you’re a prophet.” I said, “I’m no prophet.” Said, “Well, they think you are. Why
   don’t you teach them people, them Pentecostals, how to receive these things, how to get great
   spiritual blessings and enter into the Presence of God and see visions also. If you’d leave them
   alone…” I SAID, “HOW CAN I TEACH THEM ALGEBRA WHEN THEY WON’T EVEN
   LEARN THEIR ABC’S?” 48 HOW CAN THEY ACCEPT SPIRITUAL THINGS WHEN
   THEY WON’T EVEN HAVE THE COMMON DECENCY TO CLEAN THEMSELVES UP?
   Not to hurt you, but be honest with you… Unhonorable things that the Bible says that you
   shouldn’t do, yet we associate with it. Sure. See, you can’t be welcome. No, sir. You’re out of
   place with the Word, and He is the Word. Now, so much for that. We’ll get that some other
   time.
   
   16
    I think its vulgarity, I think it embarrassing to the Holy Ghost. To see a woman wearing them
   skin down tight dresses. I tell you it’s pleasing, it’s pleasing to the Holy Ghost, when the Holy
   Ghost sees a woman that’s got a dress on that hides the form of her body.
    LET’S FACE IT BROTHER AND SISTER, WE GOT TO CLEAN THIS THING OUT! IF
   WE’RE GONNA HAVE A HOLY GHOST OUTPOURING WE’RE GONNA HAVE TO
   HAVE A CLEANING OUT OF THE HOLY GHOST OF EVERY MAN AND WOMEN IN
   THIS THING. Hallelujah! GODS A HOLY GOD!
    God told Moses said, “Don’t let those priests walk up that latter!” Don’t you let them priests
   walk up that latter unless they got long underwear on that comes down clear to their ankle’s. He
   said, least I discover their nakedness and I’ll slay them.
   Exodus 20:26-Reference quote:
   26 Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar, that thy nakedness be not discovered
   thereon.
   Exodus 28:42
   42 And thou shalt make them linen breeches to cover their nakedness; from the loins even unto
   the thighs they shall reach:
    If God couldn’t look upon the nakedness of a man how much more do you think he could
   look upon the nakedness of a woman.
    And here sit the people that say they believe the prophet and believe the word of God, and the
   women sit out there and you have to… The man of God has look at the sin, sitting out there with
   their legs crossed. I tell you women ought to sit in a decent fashion.
    I’ve seen women come in my home, and I have to look over in the corner to talk to their
   husbands. And then their husband tries to act like he’s so spiritual. Why, you ole hypocrite you!
   Don’t tell me your spiritual. You need to be born again of the Holy Ghost.
    I think that’s what’s the matter today, we got a lot of intellectual Baptism of the Holy Ghost!
   If you ever get a Baptism of the Holy Ghost it’ll cause you to love holiness and hate the filth of
   the flesh. You live after the flesh your gonna die!
    Oh God, how many of us have walked out from behind the word of God and have broken our
   fellowship with Jesus Christ. Oh, God all the lusting in the minds of man and all the pride. And
   the lusting in the heart of the women. And we’re trying to have an outpouring of the Holy Ghost.
    OH GOD! WE NEED TO PRAY FOR GOD TO SEND A HOLY GHOST SIN KILLING
   REVIVAL! GLORY TO GOD! THAT WILL BURN OUT THE SIN THAT’S AMONG US.
   GODS A HOLY GOD, GOD IS A RIGHTOUS GOD.

   80 That’s what’s the matter today. We’ve drafted in our ideas, drafted in our denominations, but
   if that tree ever puts forth another fruit vine, itself, it’ll be like the original ones that went into it.
   Hallelujah! Oh, church will blend together, but we need the power of the original. We need the
   Holy Ghost, the power of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. That’s what He told us to do. 81 “I
   am the Vine, ye are the branches.” If a grapevine puts forth a shoot, and it comes out with pretty
   blue grapes, the next vine it brings out will have pretty blue grapes on it. If the first Vine come

   out, and they fell under the impact of the Holy Spirit, and they did great miracles, and signs, and
   sealed their testimony to a world…Even many of them with their own testimony, they, with their
   blood, they sealed their testimony. They went through all kinds of perils and everything to bring
   the Gospel. They suffered; they were beaten; they were punished. “Must we be carried home to
   Heaven, on a flowery bed of ease, while others fought to win the prize, and sailed through bloody
   seas?” What do we expect to do? “I must fight if I must reign. Increase my courage, Lord.”
   Certainly. We need a… 82 We don’t need a new denomination. We don’t need a new church
   building. What we need today is an old-time backwoods, sky-blue, sin-killing Pentecostal
   revival, that was borned at Pentecost and is back into the church again, the power of the Holy
   Ghost again, to bring Jesus on the scene. 83 The God of history always rises on the scene in a
   crucial moment. We need it. That’s what’s the matter with our church today. We’re getting too
   far back. We’re falling into the fashions of the world. And gradually, year by year, it begins to
   die a little and wither away. 84 It’s pruning time pretty soon. God will cut it back as sure as I’m
   standing in this pulpit. God will cut her back to make her bear fruit. He will cut the works of the
   world out of it one of these days. Such a disgrace, the way the church has carried on under the
   name of religion. 85 AND WE FIND OUT, WHEN JESUS LEFT, DEATH SET IN. WHEN
   JESUS LEAVES OUR CHURCH, THE POWER OF THE HOLY SPIRIT LEAVES OUR
   CHURCH, IT BEGINS TO DWINDLE AND—AND DIE. AND AFTER WHILE THERE’S
   NOTHING NO MORE TO IT. NOW, WHEN JESUS LEFT, DEATH SET IN. OH, WHAT A
   SAD TIME IT WAS. 86 And notice, they wondered around, and they sent for Jesus, but He
   didn’t come. They sent for Him again, and He didn’t come, but He knowed what He was going
   to do. He knows tonight, what He’s going to do. It’s not lost with Him: He knows exactly what
   He’s fixing to do. He’s going to raise a people up, just as certain as I’m standing in this pulpit.
   He will raise a people for His Name’s sake out of the Gentile generation. He will do it. 87 It’s
   the Jews’ time’s right at hand now, and of the Gentiles are ending out, because they just went on
   out. They’re rejecting Christ; they’re rejecting their signs; they’re rejecting everything that’s
   called godly, and brand it as some kind of telepathy or devil power and do…They’re
   blaspheming the Holy Ghost and sealing themselves away from God. And God will take that
   minority, after while, and raise it up into a powerful Church, and then turn the Spirit to the
   Jews, and take the Gentile Church home. Exactly right. She’s in the making now. Well, we’re
   at the end time, nearly.
    Oh, God wants to come down and fellowship, but it’s too dirty for him. Oh, My God help us!
   God said, you have not chosen me, but I have chosen you to fellowship with me. You didn’t
   choose me but I chose you. You was and ole filthy dirty sin lovin, sloppin around in the world.
   (Amen) I come down and chose you because I called you before the foundation of the world.

   6 Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and

   my name, he may give it you.
    I know the preachers say that you got your names put in the book of life when you went out
   and excepted Jesus Christ. But the Bible says, “That you we’re predestinated and foreordained to
   fellowship with Jesus Christ by the Blood of the Lamb that was Slain before the foundation of

   justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.
   31 What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us?
    Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual
   blessings in heavenly places in Christ Jesus.” And he has “Predestinated us unto the adoption of
   children by Jesus Christ.” By “His” own “Will” and purpose, he did it. God purposed that he
   will, that he would have sons and daughters that would be fortified behind the word of God! That
   would love God and fellowship with God.

   171 When they killed Jesus at the cross, the substance come from His body, to make up the

   Thy hands I commend My Spirit.” What came from His body was water, Blood, Spirit. 172
   Now, First John 5:7 tells you about that, “There are three that bear record in Heaven, the
   Father, the Word (which is Christ,) and the Holy Ghost.” And these three agree in one; they’re
   not one, but they agree in one. And there are three that bear record…Or, “They are one,” I
   mean. I’m mistaken there. “And the three that bear record in earth, is the water, Blood, and
   Spirit, and they agree in one.” 173 You can be sanctified without being justified. And you can
   be justified without being sanctified. You can be sanctified without receiving the Holy Ghost.
   That’s exactly. 174 The disciples, in John 17:17, was sanctified and given power to cast out
   devils, but still didn’t have the Holy Ghost. See? Sure. Had to go up to Pentecost, and wait till
   the Holy Ghost come.
    John said, “If we say, that we have fellowship with him and we walk in darkness we lie and

   43 There could take about a good five hour discussion on that. When you accept Christ as your
   Saviour and are then ready for baptism in water, you have not yet been converted; you’re only
   believing unto repentance. Conversion means “to be changed.” 44 Now, to make this efficient,
   Jesus said to Peter who had also followed Him for three and a half years…And in the Book of
   Matthew the 10th chapter Jesus gave Peter power against unclean spirits, to go out and cast
   them out, to heal the sick, and to preach the Gospel. He had power to do this. And in Saint John
   17:17 JESUS SANCTIFIED PETER THROUGH THE TRUTH, SAID THE WORD WAS
   THE TRUTH, AND HE WAS THE WORD. And then at—before Pentecost He said. “After you
   are converted, then strengthen your brethren.” You are only taking steps to conversion as you

   59-1217 - What Was The Holy Ghost Given For?
   William Marrion Branham
   But the Scripture says, in John, that, “No man can call Jesus the Christ, only by the Holy
   Ghost.” You’ve, actually, by the Scripture…Let me stop here just a minute, ‘fore I finish reading.
   YOU ARE NOT CONVERTED UNTIL YOU’VE RECEIVED THE HOLY GHOST. That’s
   right. 54 YOU ARE BELIEVING “UNTO.” The Holy Spirit has spoke to you, and you’ve
   publicly confessed Him. The devil has the same thing. “I believe Him to be the Son of God.” So
   does the devil. But you’re walking on towards Him. When, Peter had been called and justified,
   by believing on the Lord Jesus Christ; and in John 17:17, Jesus sanctified them through the
   Word, for the Word was the Truth. AND HE WAS THE WORD. 1st, John says, “IN THE
   BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, AND THE WORD WAS WITH GOD, AND THE WORD
   WAS GOD. AND THE WORD WAS MADE FLESH, AND DWELLED AMONG US.” HE
   WAS THE WORD, SO HE SANCTIFIED THEM. He said, “Father,” speaking to the Spirit in
   Him, “I SANCTIFY THEM THROUGH THE WORD,” Hisself, by laying His hands upon
   them. “THY WORD IS THE TRUTH.” JUST MERELY SPOKE HIM INTO EXISTENCE,
   IN THE WOMB of a woman; oh, TOTALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO BE ANY OTHER
   WAY THAN THIS WORD OF GOD TO MAKE HIM MANIFEST. “I sanctify them.” 55 He
   gave them power against unclean spirits. They went out. He put their names in the Lamb’s Book
   of Life. And He sent them out, John…Matthew 10, and gave them power over unclean spirits;
   cast out evil spirits, and do works, and so forth. And they come back, rejoicing, said, “Even the
   devils is subject to us.” He said, “Don’t rejoice because the devils is subject unto you; but
   rejoice because your names in the Book.” And Judas was with them. See how close he can
   come; right on up through justification, move right on into sanctification. But where did he
   show his light? Where did he show hisself? Before Pentecost, he showed his colors. 56 Watch,
   that spirit will be just as pious and just as sanctimonious as it can be, until it comes to the Holy
   Ghost, and they’ll cut It off right there. That’s that spirit (can’t you see it?) moving up, the
   antichrist. And Jesus said, “They would be so close together, in the last days, it would deceive
   the very Elected if possible.” BUT, REMEMBER, IT’S JUST THE ELECTED THAT WILL
   SEE IT. GOD CALLS BY ELECTION. You, aren’t you happy that you’re one of them?
   [Congregation says, “Amen.”—Ed.] Aren’t you, people here tonight, knowing that something in
   your heart tugging, “I want that Holy Spirit. I want You, Lord, in my heart”? That’s because
   God put your name on the Lamb’s Book of Life before the foundation of the world. He said that.
   “No man can come to Me,” said Jesus, “except My Father has drawed him first. And all that
   comes to Me, I’ll give them Eternal Life.” What is Eternal Life? The Holy Spirit. “Eternal Life,”
   take that word and run it in the Greek, and it said, Zoe. Zoe is the Holy Spirit. “All that the
   Father has given Me will come to Me. And all that comes to Me, I’ll give him the Holy Ghost,
   and I’ll raise him up at the last day. I will do it,” He said. Not no if-and-and’s about It. “I will.
   All that comes; and I give Eternal Life.” He’ll have to raise, ’cause he’s got Eternal Life. He
   has to come. Can’t die no more than God can die. 57 Oh, my dear friends from around this
   country and in this little city, if I could only, with my human voice, place into your heart THE
   IMPORTANCE OF RECEIVING THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST, IT WOULD BE
   THE MOST WONDERFUL REVELATION THAT YOU EVER HAD IN YOUR LIFE. To see
   
   23
   what…YOU MUST DO IT. LET ME MAKE THAT CLEAR, ABOUT, “YOU’RE NOT
   CONVERTED.”
    Then why is it not out there in the Pentecostal churches then? How about it out there? They’re
   not under the blood! You can’t be under the Blood unless you’re under the word. How can they
   be under the Blood when they turned down the word through the prophet? The prophet of God
   had the word, and the Blood was in the Word. That’s why he kept saying, It’s the Word, it’s the
   word, it’s the word! Because the blood is in the word! Oh, how we ought to esteem the word of
   God. How we ought to reverence the word of God.

   tell the people. 295 And I was just preaching, Charlie, just as hard as I could preach, just laying
   it on, you know, and say, “All these great things, this what God is doing. Look at this. He
   discerns the thoughts of the heart. What is It? The Word.” And go like that. And, oh, I wish I
   could remember what I would say and what my text was. I can’t think of it. See? But I was just
   preaching away. 296 And I was watching myself do it. And then when I was standing there,
   looking, and watching myself preach It. 297 And I was just preaching, to-who-wouldn’t-have-it.
   And after a bit, I raised up, you know, and I thought, “Glory to God!” I said, “Look at these
   wonderful things, and this, that!” 298 Directly, I noticed the people begin to get like they was
   physically hungry. And so they had enough spiritual, so they started walking away. And some of
   them…[Brother Branham yawns—Ed.] Started walking away. I thought, “What’s the matter
   with everybody?” 299 And—and I looked, and here some young couples going along, to my side.
   I thought…I said, “Just a minute, friend! JUST A MINUTE! YOU’LL BE BACK AGAIN
   WHEN THE EVENING SHADOWS FALL.” SEE? I SAID, “YOU’LL BE BACK AGAIN.
   But let me give you this first climax. WHERE DOES ALL THESE THINGS COME FROM,
   THAT I’VE SHOWED YOU? WHERE ARE THEY FROM?” I SAID, “HERE THEY ARE.
   THEY ARE IN THE WORD OF GOD. THEY ARE THUS SAITH THE LORD, HIS
   PROMISE. CAUSE,” I SAID, “ALL OF YOU BEAR ME RECORD, WITNESS THIS, THAT
   MY COMMISSION IS, ‘STAY WITH THE WORD.’” I SAID, “WHAT’S THE MATTER
   
   24
   WITH ALL OF YOU? CAN’T YOU UNDERSTAND THE WORD? YOU MUST
   UNDERSTAND IT.” 300 And some of them said, “Man, I’d like to have some biscuits,” and so
   like that. 301 Well, I just thought, “Well, glory to God! If they want biscuits, let them go get
   them.” 302 So I—I turned around. I thought, “Oh, but, you know what? The shadows is going to
   fall, after while, right away.” I said, “Then, tonight, when that congregation gathers in again,
   I’ll put the climax to them, and told them that the things that THEY HAVE SEEN ME DO IS
   FOUND IN THE WORD OF GOD, not in some mythical book or some organization. IT’S
   FOUND IN THE WORD. SEE? EVERY BIT OF IT, IN THE WORD, ’CAUSE I’M
   COMMISSIONED TO THAT.” 303 I thought, “You know, they’ll, every one, be back tonight,
   so here is what I’ll do. I’ll background, kind of background.” You know the way I do it on these
   church ages and things, say what I said before. “I’ll background it, on the Word, and then this
   great, marvelous climax.” I said, “What a time it’ll be! Praise be to God!” AND I SEEN
   MYSELF GETTING REAL LITTLE, AND HEARD THAT, “PRAISE BE TO GOD.” I SEEN
   MYSELF FADING UP LIKE THAT. And here I was, standing there. 304 Now, here is the
   interpretation thereof. See? The first thing that I have done, the things that’s been done, has been
   mystical to the people, most of them. I don’t mean the Full Gospel and saints of God, but, I
   mean, in most the people. And you never want to look at the world, kosmos, as the Message of
   God. When you go and you say… 305 Like Boze said, “I’ve always…” Said, “I had a dream,
   years ago, that the—the God would send me to Chicago and shake Chicago for the glory of
   God.” I said, “Joseph, He has already done it.” “Why,” he said, “they haven’t been shaken
   since Moody.” 306 I said, “That? I’m talking about the Church. That’s cannon fodder out there.
   That’s just dust of the earth, that bunch cramming through the streets, painted Jezebels and
   everything.” I said, “That’s out there. Them big old lodges and things will crumble and fall into
   the streets there.” I said, “He is talking about the Church. The Church that seen the revelation of
   Jesus Christ made manifest, and they recognize It. They may not be fifteen out of Chicago. There
   may not be ten in this generation, out of the whole city of Chicago, come forth.” 307 Did you
   ever think of that? “AS IT WAS IN THE DAYS OF NOAH, SO WILL IT BE AT THE
   COMING OF THE SON OF MAN, WHEREIN EIGHT SOULS WERE SAVED.” Uh-huh.
   How many come out of Sodom? See what I mean? I doubt being a handful. See? 308 But the
   Church Itself has received the shaking. They’ve recognized it. They knowed the Word. They
   seen the Word when It was being materialized, and they caught It. Now look at that for a
   minute, now. 309 And this first Message, when they’d see It, everybody rallied for It, said, “Oh,
   glory to God! Oh, if I could see this, that, and the other.” And they go right away, the same way
   they come in. See? 310 And now they think, “Well, I don’t know. Where would you join? If I
   don’t come to this, it’ll be this way. And I’ll be kicked out, over here, and I won’t have nothing to
   here.” Brethren set down and say, “Well, what would I do if I…?” SEE THERE? THEY
   WON’T STOP LONG ENOUGH TO RECOGNIZE IT’S THE WORD THAT GOD
   PROMISED, BEING MANIFESTED. See? AND THEY WALKED AWAY. 311 BUT, DON’T
   WORRY, THE SHADOWS ARE CLOSE AT HAND, see, when I return to the field. 312 You
   remember, the other night, of the Message that He give me back there when I was laying the
   corner stone? Just exactly. Said, “Do the work…” Said, “When you come out of this vision,
   read Second Timothy 4.” You know, it’s laying right there in the cornerstone, thirty-three
   years ago. 313 Said, “Do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of your ministry. FOR
   THE TIME WILL COME WHEN THEY WILL NOT ENDURE SOUND DOCTRINE; BUT
   AFTER THEIR OWN LUSTS SHALL HEAP TEACHERS, HAVING ITCHING EARS;
   TURN FROM FABLE…FROM TRUTH UNTO FABLES.” IF THAT HASN’T BEEN, JUST
   
   25
   WORD BY WORD! [Blank spot on tape—Ed.] 314 But, remember, then, the other night, when I
   never did read the rest of it. THE THIRTY-SOMETHING YEARS THAT I’VE PREACHED
   IN THIS TABERNACLE, NEVER ONE TIME DID I EVER GO ANY FARTHER THAN
   THAT, AND I DON’T KNOW WHY. 315 I OFTEN WONDER, TILL, ONE DAY, I SEEN
   WHERE JESUS PICKED UP THE SCROLL AND BEGIN TO READ, AND READ HALF
   OF THE PROPHECY, and stopped, and said, there in Capernaum, He said, “And this day, this
   prophecy is fulfilled.” WHY DIDN’T HE READ THE REST OF IT? IT PERTAINS TO HIS
   SECOND COMING. See?
    And now the devil is trying to get the people to believe that we’re not even supposed to
   preach the gospel. THE GOSPEL IS THE POWER OF GOD UNTO SALVATION. For
   everyone that believeth. Both for the Jews and the gentiles. And now the devil wants to get the
   people to believe that we’re not supposed to preach the word. Sure!
   Romans 1:16-17-Reference quote:
   16 For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to
   every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.
   17 For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The
   just shall live by faith.
    Then you can sit up there with all them sins in your life the devil. Oh, you don’t mean to do it,
   but the devil does it. No brother, they can’t stand the word of God. There ain’t no demon or devil
   that can stand the word of God. Oh, they can stand the miracles, they can stand a little sign or
   something brother! But brother they can’t stand the word, when you begin to preach the do’s and
   the don’ts of the gospel. That’s when they begin to walk out the door!

   179 So I’ve watched for something. HAS IT SLIPPED BY US IN HUMILITY AND WE’VE

   it’s later than you think. IF NOT, THEN THERE’S COMING ONE WITH A MESSAGE
   THAT’S STRAIGHT ON THE BIBLE, AND QUICK WORK WILL CIRCLE THE EARTH.
   The seeds will go in newspapers, reading material, until every predestinated Seed of God has

   has drawed will hear It and come. That’ll be, the predestinated Seed will hear the Word.

   64-0214 - The Voice Of The Sign
   William Marrion Branham
   87 Notice now, the Bible was written by the prophets. We see that It says that, “The man of old,
   moved by the Holy Ghost, wrote the Bible.” In Hebrews 1, It says, “God, in sundry times in
   divers manners spake to the fathers by the prophets, in this last day through His Son, Jesus
   Christ.” See? Because He was the manifestation of all the Word of the prophet, and He was
   the fullness of the Word. The Word was in Him, all the Word. He was Emmanuel, “God
   
   26
   manifested in flesh.” 88 God come down in the form of the Holy Spirit, two wings like a dove
   settling down and went upon Him, saying, “This is My beloved Son in whom I am pleased to
   dwell in.” Now the King James there says, “In whom I am pleased to dwell.” What difference
   does it make, “In whom I’m pleased to dwell,” or, “Who I’m pleased to dwell in”? See? “In
   Whom I’m pleased to dwell.” There it was, God in man, heaven and earth come together.
   GOD AND MAN UNITED. THE GREATEST HOUR, TILL THAT TIME, THERE WAS ON
   THE EARTH, OR EVER HAD BEEN. 89 Notice, the Pillar of Fire sign, and then the Voice
   of the sign spoke. See? The Pillar sign, of the Voice, was there ready to speak. THE SIGN
   ONLY SHOWED THAT THE VOICE WAS READY TO SPEAK. Get the idea? [Congregation
   says, “Amen.”—Ed.] 90 THE SIGN SHOWS GOD’S VOICE IS READY TO SPEAK, AND
   WHEN GOD SHOWS A SIGN AS HE IS IN THE LAST DAYS.

   203 He said, “If you come back at all, God hasn’t spoke to me.” Uh-huh? See? THERE WAS
   A PROPHET, THERE WAS A SIGN; THERE WAS HIS VOICE. AND TO FAIL TO OBEY
   IT BROUGHT JUDGMENT. 204 The Holy Ghost is our prophet today. FAIL TO HEAR HIS
   VOICE? HE’S IDENTIFIED IN THE SCRIPTURE, THAT HE WOULD SAY THESE
   THINGS. JESUS CHRIST, THE FORM OF THE HOLY GHOST! 205 GOD DEALT WITH
   THIS ONE MAN. THIS, GOD NEVER DEALS WITH GROUPS; IT’S WITH ONE MAN.
   Elijah wasn’t a group. John wasn’t a group. They wasn’t a group or a denomination, neither one
   of them. But both of them condemned such. That’s right. John said, “Don’t you think to say we
   have Abraham to our father. God is able of these stones to rise children to Abraham.” 206 AND
   THE END-TIME SIGN WILL HAVE AN END-TIME VOICE. And the end-time sign will be
   according to what is predicted in the Bible. AND THE END-TIME VOICE, THAT
   FOLLOWS THE END-TIME SIGN, WILL BE EXACTLY IDENTIFIED IN THE
   SCRIPTURE, WILL BE THE SCRIPTURE THAT’S BEEN PROMISED. 207 Now we’ve
   read in Luke 17 what the end-time sign would be, would be like it was at Sodom, a promise. And
   we have the Sodom in the natural, why can’t we believe the sign in spiritual here? If you can see
   the Scriptures, also, Luke 17 is the sign, and Malachi 4 is the Voice. The sign was like God
   manifested in flesh, knowing the secrets of the heart; AND THE VOICE OF MALACHI 4 WAS
   TURNING THE PEOPLE AWAY FROM THEIR CREEDS, BACK TO THE FAITH OF
   THE FATHERS. That’s the sign. 208 You know what? I’m closing now. SIGNS ARE
   USUALLY ACCEPTED, SURE; BUT, THE VOICE, OH, NO. THE VOICE THAT
   FOLLOWS THE SIGN, THEY DON’T WANT NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT. YES. 209
   Jesus’ sign, as Messiah, to heal the sick, they accepted that. But one day He said, “I and the
   Father are One.” 210 Oh, my, THAT VOICE WASN’T ACCEPTED. They said, “You make
   Yourself God, equal with God.” He said, “I’m the Son of God.” 211 “Oh, my, how could God
   have a Son?” See? “Far be it from God having a Son!” 212 BUT, YOU SEE, THEY
   BELIEVED THE—THE SIGN, THE SICK COULD BE HEALED, AND, OH, THAT WAS
   WONDERFUL, THAT WAS JUST DANDY. BUT WHEN IT COME TO THE VOICE, THEY
   DIDN’T WANT TO BELIEVE THE VOICE. What’d they do? They put Him out.
   
   27
    My God I wouldn’t care if there wasn’t five left, I’d rather preach the word of God! Amen, I
   don’t care about numbers, I’m concerned about quality. God don’t need a bunch of people to
   shake this thing. He just needs some people that are cleansed by the washing of the water of the
   word and line up with the word of God. Amen!
    Roman’s 8:28 said, that God has predestinated us to be conformed to his very image. Amen!
   Roman’s 8:28-Reference quote:
   28 And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the
   called according to his purpose.
   29 For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his
   Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.
   30 Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also
   justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.
   31 What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us?
    Satan’s Job is to stop this great fellowship! It’s his job to see that you don’t fellowship with
   him. Because if you get in fellowshipping with God and his word, there’s something gonna take
   place. Miracles are gonna take place. Amen? (Amen) Signs and wonders are gonna take place.
   The blinded eyes will be open and the dead will be raised. And the gospel will be preached with
   signs wonders and miracles confirming them. So, Satan is out to stop this word, he’s out to stop
   this fellowship with God.
    He stopped Adam, he stopped Eve. Amen! Fellowship was to continue as long as Adam
   stayed fortified behind Gods word. Is, that right? (Amen) When Adam stepped out behind Gods
   word, he forfeited the title deed to the earth. He lost his power; he lost his authority that he had
   with God. And Adam walked out of there like a little dog, with his tail between its legs, whipped,
   whipped. No more power, no more authority, no more joy, no more blessings.
    But oh God! God said, “It’s all right Adam, I made a way for you.” He killed a lamb and
   clothed him with it. And he said, “Awe, I will restore this fellowship one day that I had with you
   in the Garden of Eden.
    How is he gonna restore it? By the Blood of the Lamb! Hallelujah! By the word being made
   flesh, bleeding and dying for it.

   63-0317E - The Breach Between The Seven Church Ages And The Seven Seals
   William Marrion Branham
   220 Others had guessed at, in the denominational age. But, see, he must be this man, the
   seventh angel of…Revelation 10:1-4 is a…The seventh angel has the mysteries of God given
   to him, and finishes all the mysteries that’s been left off, down through the denominational
   ages. 221 Now you can see why I do not strike at my brethren in denomination. It’s the system of
   denomination! THEY DO NOT, THERE IS NO NEED OF THEM TRYING TO KNOW IT,
   BECAUSE IT COULD NOT BE REVEALED. THAT’S ACCORDING TO THE WORD. They
   presumed at It, and believed It was there, and by faith walked by It, but now It’s evidently
   proved. Amen. Oh, my, what a—what a Scripture! 222 Now watch. Then it is He, the Lamb, that
   takes His Kingly position, when His saints come to crown Him, “Lord of lord, and King of
   kings.” See? 223 See, “Time has run out.” Revelation 10:6, “There is no more time.” 224
   Notice, there is “seven horns” on this Lamb. Did you notice it? “Having seven horns.” We’ve
   just been through that. Horns means “power,” to the animal. And, notice, He was not a animal,
   because He took the Book out of the right hand of Him that sat upon the Throne. See? Notice.
   Oh, my! 225 I believe I had that wrote down somewhere; oh, to break the Seals, and to loose
   the title, the title deed, and the—the Message to the last angel. And He takes His Kingly place.
   That’s what He comes forth now to do. Now watch, when He comes out, “The seven horns.” 226
   Now, when he saw this Lamb, John looking at It, It—IT LOOKED LIKE HE HAD BEEN
   SLAIN, BLOODY. AND HE HAS COME FROM ETERNITY, and He ceased to be a
   Mediator. 227 Then pray to Mary as much as you want to! “There was no man in Heaven, and in
   earth, or no person, no being nowhere else, could take it.” John even wept about it. Oh, Catholic
   friend, can’t you see that? Don’t pray to some dead person. 228 The Lamb is the only Mediator.
   See? He was the One that came forth. And what did He do now? He’s been back here
   interceding, until His Blood has atoned for every person. And the Lamb, now, knows what’s
   written in the Book. So, He knowed from the foundation of the world their names were in
   There, so He has stood back here and re-…and—and, but, done Mediator work like this
   until…mediatorial work, till every one that’s been put in the Book has been redeemed, and it’s
   finished. And now He walks out. See? HE DONE HIS KINSMAN WORK. HE IS ALL…YOU
   KNOW WHAT THE KINSMAN WORK WAS? To testify before elders. You remember Boaz
   kicking off his shoe, and so forth? He has done all this now. 229 NOW HE COMES TO TAKE
   HIS BRIDE. Amen. HE COMES NOW AS KING. HE IS LOOKING FOR HIS QUEEN.
   Amen. Amen. IN THIS BOOK IS THE WHOLE SECRET OF IT, WRAPPED UP AROUND,
   SEVEN SEALS. Oh, brother! Seven Seals, waiting for Him to come. Notice. 230 Let’s get these
   symbols. Well, it’s just nine o’clock. We got three hours or more, to go. We got…let’s
   just…Satan keep telling me them people is getting tired, so I guess they are. But let—let’s take
   
   29
   this, anyhow. 231 “Seven horns” was the seven churches, see, the seven church ages, because
   that was the Lamb’s protection. What He protected His rights with, on earth, was a God-sent
   Group of people that protected; see, the horn on the Lamb. 232 “Seven eyes” are the seven
   messengers of the seven church ages. “Seven eyes,” seven seers. 233 Would you like to write
   down some Scripture? Let’s just turn to it. What do you say, you got that much time?
   [Congregation says, “Amen.”—Ed.] All right. Let’s go to Zechariah, the Book of—of Zechariah,
   just a little bit, and we’ll—we’ll read some of this. 234 I—I don’t want to keep you too long on
   these things. And—and I…But, yet, I don’t want you to miss it. What’s any more important than
   this? [Congregation says, “Amen.”—Ed.] Yeah. What’s more…[Someone in the congregation
   says, “Brother Branham?”] What? [“You don’t measure that.”] Nothing more important than
   Eternal Life to a person. And we must—we must get this now, and—and be sure that we get it.
   All right. All right, sir. 235 And now we want to read Zechariah the 3rd chapter. I think that’s
   right, now, Zechariah 3. We’re just going to get these symbols here, if I’ve got my Scriptures
   wrote down. I was just shouting all over the place, this afternoon, when I hit this. So I—I just
   don’t know whether I got it right, or not. I hope I have. Zechariah 3, let’s see if it’s…I got 89
   here, but it must be 8 to 9. All right. All right. I know it can’t be 89. Zechariah 3:8 and 9. Hear
   now, O Joshua the high priest, thou, and thy fellows that sit with thee: FOR THEY ARE MEN
   WONDERED AT: FOR, BEHOLD, I WILL BRING FORTH MY SERVANT THE BRANCH
   (CHRIST). For behold the stone that I will lay before Joshua; upon (stone) one stone shall be
   seven eyes: (seven eyes), behold, I will engrave the graving thereon, saith the Lord of host,…I
   will remove the iniquity of the land in one day. 236 Now let’s turn over to Zechariah 4:10, 4:10.
   Listen. …who hath despised the day of small things (God in simplicity, see)? for they shall
   rejoice, and…see the plummet in the hands of Zerubbabel with whose…with those seven; these
   are the eyes of the Lord, which run to and fro through the whole earth. 237 “The seven eyes.”
   Eyes mean “seeing.” Seeing means “prophets, seers.” This Lamb had seven horns, and on each
   horn had an eye, “seven eyes.” What is it? Christ and His Bride; seven church ages. Out of
   there was seven prophets that went forth, seven seers, eyes. So, the last one must be a seer.
   [Brother Branham knocked on the pulpit two times as he said, “a seer.”—Ed.] All right. 238
   Notice, He is not an animal. “He took the Book out of the right hand of Him that sat upon the
   Throne.” Who was It? The—the Owner, the original Owner, that had THE BOOK OF
   REDEMPTION IN HIS RIGHT HAND. And no Angel, no Angelic Being, nothing else, could
   take the place. “AND THIS BLOODY LAMB WALKED OUT AND TOOK THE BOOK OUT
   OF HIS HAND.” WHEW! What was it? Brother, this is the most sublime thing in the Scripture.
   An act that not an Angel, not nothing, could do it. “And the Lamb come and took It from the
   right hand of Him that sat upon the Throne.” 239 What is it? NOW IT BELONGS TO THE
   LAMB. Amen. God’s laws required. He’s the One that holds It. GOD’S LAW REQUIRED A
   KINSMAN REDEEMER. AND THE LAMB COME OUT, HOLDING IT, “I AM THEIR
   KINSMAN. I AM THEIR REDEEMER. I NOW…I HAVE MADE INTERCESSION FOR
   THEM, AND NOW I’VE COME TO CLAIM THEIR RIGHTS FOR THEM.” AMEN.
   THERE’S THE ONLY ONE. “I’VE COME TO CLAIM THEIR RIGHTS. In that, they have a
   right to everything that lost in the fall, and I’ve paid the price.” 240 Oh, brother! Whew! Don’t
   that make you feel religious inside? [Congregation says, “Amen.”—Ed.] “NOT BY GOOD
   WORKS WHICH WE HAVE DONE, BUT BY HIS MERCY.”
   
   30
    Oh, God how Adam and Eve got us into all this trouble. Forfeited, can you imagine? What a
   great thing Adam had and then he forfeited it because of his fellowship with the woman in the
   flesh. Oh, what a sad thing.
    All right! We’re so glad that God promised us a way of a complete restoration of this great
   fellowship in this Great Garden of Eden. Amen!

   53-0613 - God's Provided Way
   William Marrion Branham
   6 How that on one Man the iniquity of all the world was laid… All the sins, all the sickness,
   all the—all—everything that was wrong was laid upon that one Sheep, GOD’S PROVIDED
   LAMB. And He took Him up to Calvary and crucified Him to be the—the—the substitute for our
   wickedness, and our sickness, and our transgressions, and all that we’ve done against, God
   and all we’ve done against ourselves, and ever… He—He was—He was God’s provided
   Sacrifice for us, God’s provided way. Now, God has always had a way. He’s got a way tonight.
   AND GOD, ALWAYS BEFORE HE SENDS JUDGMENT, HE ALWAYS MAKES A WAY
   OF ESCAPE. OUT OF EVERY TRIAL, GOD MAKES A WAY OF ESCAPE. And God makes
   a way… BEFORE HE SENDS HIS JUDGMENT, I MIGHT SAY FIRST, BEFORE HE
   SENDS JUDGMENT, HE ALWAYS SENDS MERCY.
    We find out that the sons of God have always broken this fellowship that they had with
   Jehovah God, one time or another. Now God started restoring that fellowship that he had with
   Adam in the Garden of Eden, little by little. And he gave them a substitute to restore this
   fellowship by. And that was by the Blood of a Lamb.
    If they would put their hands upon this goat, lamb or bull or dove-pigeon or whatever it was,
   and when they jerked the head of the pigeon off and the blood run out. That means they could
   look to that blood and for their ole sins.

   53-1122 - The Resurrection Of Lazarus
   William Marrion Branham
   I believe in the resurrection. I believe in a bodily physical resurrection. I believe in the physical
   bodily return of Jesus Christ. I believe that His Church is His representative on the earth now. I
   believe that the Church is washed with the Blood of Jesus Christ. And the Church is a Holy
   Ghost filled Church, preaches holiness to the very extremes. Don’t you think so? I think of in the
   Bible when there was a sin offering, they taken two turtledoves, or a cleansing for leprosy…
   Leprosy in the Bible was a type of sin. They used to take two doves, and one of them, they took
   and pulled its head off, and turned it up like this and bled the blood… let the blood come on the
   other live mate, take it to the window and turn the dove loose, the live one, and is—as it fluttered
   its little wings, why, the blood fell down to the ground off of its dead mate, and that blood hitting
   and splattering on the ground from the dead mate, cried to the Lord, “Holy, holy, holy, unto
   the Lord.” 22 How perfect that is of the Church. How that Jesus Christ, when God came down
   and was manifested in flesh, took upon Himself the form of sinful flesh, was killed and
   crucified at Calvary, and the Blood of the dead mate is put upon the Church, the living Bride,
   
   31
   and She goes across with her wings a flapping and the Blood of Jesus Christ crying, “Holy,
   holy, holy, is the Lord God Almighty,” a perfect cleansing for leprosy. Leprosy, there was no
   cure for leprosy. They haven’t found it yet. Only God can cure leprosy. They haven’t found even
   nothing for it, to help it. But it’s a type of sin. It sets in so gradual; it’s painless. Just moves right
   in; you don’t know it until you’re dying. Big white warts come out all over you, limbs drop off
   and everything, eat you right into the… Just—just eats you up, leprosy. Jesus was the only One
   Who could heal this leprosy. He’s the only One today Who can heal this leprosy. 23 But now, in
   the beginning of Jesus’ ministry, He’s such a great Person, there never was no one ever on the
   earth like Him, and there never will be anyone like Him. He was—He was the only begotten Son
   of Almighty God. We are sons by adoption, through Him. But He is God’s only begotten Son.
   Adam was God’s son. Do you believe that? He was God’s creative son. But this is His begotten
   Son. God begotten His Son.
   
    You see that ole Hebrew that went up there, and he was coveting after his neighbor’s wife.
   And the Bible said, thou shall not covet son, thy neighbor’s wife. Is, that right? (Amen) Alright,
   it convicted him. Moses read the law and it convicted him for coveting after his neighbor’s wife.
   He had to go up every time he coveted. He had to go up there a bulla, a lamb or a goat or
   something and let the priest kill it and he would put his hands upon that lamb signifying that the
   Lamb of God was coming one day. And by faith he looked towards that Lamb of God that was
   coming, that was going to die and restore this great fellowship in the Garden of Eden! But when
   he laid his hands upon it, the lamb saying, Bahaa, Bahaa the blood came out. Amen! You
   sprinkle the blood all over the thing there. But he went away left with the same desire to lust
   after his neighbor’s wife, that he had when he went up there yesterday. Amen! And the spirit of
   God couldn’t…There was no spirit in the lamb that could come and collect upon the believer and
   make him to be conformed into the image of God himself.
    But Oh hallelujah, God said, ONE DAY THE LAMB OF GOD WOULD COME, AND IT
   WOULDN’T BE A NATURAL LAMB, BUT IT WOULD BE THE ESCAPE GOAT OF GOD.
   AND THERE THE BLOOD WOULD BE APPLIED BY THE WORD, Hallelujah! And there
   the spirit of God would rest upon us and take us out of that desire that we had to sin. Then there
   would be no more desire to sin. There would be no more desire to cut your hair. There would be
   no more desire to ware those skin-down tight dresses. There would be no desire for the husband
   to mistreat his wife, and do all these things lusting after the women the way that they do.

   55-0223 - Job
   William Marrion Branham
   67 Look back yonder when Adam was leaving with his sweetheart, going out under
   condemnation, with a shadow—a shadow of redemption somewhere, because there was blood
   running over them. Somewhere there was a shadow; he knew it. And I hear something going
   [Brother Branham claps—Ed.]. What is it? It’s the old, bloody sheepskin beating up and down
   on his legs, speaking of some time. “There’s a land beyond the river, that they call the sweet
   forever, and we only reach that shore by faith decree…” Knowing that someday, they’d get
   back into Eden again. And now, as I see Him going yonder now, the second Adam going up the
   hill, the little spots on His back. They get bigger, bigger, bigger, as He walks on. What is it?
   After while they all go into one spot. I hear something beating again. [Brother Branham claps—
   
   32
   Ed.] What is it? There goes the second Adam, no more than Jehovah Himself, Who comes
   down and was made flesh (To what?), even to go to hell with His sweetheart, to redeem her
   back to the One Who…?… Christ to redeem His Bride. Hallelujah! He seen it in Adam
   yonder. And He come down, was made flesh, Kinfolks with us, that He might marry the
   human race to Himself. There He is, going yonder to Calvary. 68 As He’s moving up the hill,
   and His poor, little shoulder rubbing, the old bee of death humming around Him, “It ain’t going
   to be long till I’ll get Him.” Buzzing all around and around, and after while it had to sting Him.
   But, friend, you know, if a bee ever stings anybody deeply, he can’t sting no more. He pulls his
   stinger out. So he hasn’t got no more stinger. And I tell you, that’s the reason God was made
   flesh, here on earth, in order to hold the stinger of death. And now the—death has no more
   sting. The bee can swarm and buzz, but he can’t sting. “O death, where is thy sting? Grave,
   where is thy victory?” BUT CHRIST, THE KINSMAN REDEEMER HAS MADE A WAY OF
   ESCAPE FOR EVERY BELIEVER ON THIS EARTH TODAY. The bee might hum; the bee
   might buzz; the bee might try to make you afraid. But I can point yonder to Calvary, where God
   Himself was made flesh, when He held the stinger of death, and took my place as a sinner,
   and paid the price. And He laid out the welcome mat to me to come home. “Whosoever will, let
   him come and drink from the fountains of the waters of Life freely. He that comes I will in no
   wise cast out.” 69 Oh, my, no wonder Paul could say, when he heard the axes out there, being
   sharpened… When I stood in his cell a few days ago, where they chopped his head off, and they
   was bringing the axe in, the old bee humming around him. He said, “Now, I got you.” He said,
   “Death, where is your sting?” It was left in Calvary, yonder. “Grave, where is thy victory? But
   thanks be to God, Who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.” “God so loved the
   world that He gave,” so loved… Adam so loved Eve that he went out with her. Christ so loved
   the Church that He went with her. “God so loved the world…” Adam went with Eve, and her
   wrong; she was wrong. He knowed the wrong, he was innocent, but she was guilty. But Adam
   said, “I’ll go with her.” And Christ looked at the Church, and knowing it was wrong, yet
   Christ went with us to take our place yonder as a sinner, to die for us, to take the sting out of
   death for us. Sinner, how can you reject such matchless love? 70 No wonder Job said, “I know
   my Redeemer liveth, at the last days He’s going to stand upon the earth. And though the skin
   worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God. I’ll see Him for myself; my eyes shall
   behold and not another.” Do you believe it tonight? Our time’s a swayed from us. Oh, how the
   Holy Spirit seem to be moving in my heart. I can’t think of nothing, friends, nothing no greater,
   than how that Jesus come down here on earth and made the way of redemption, and fulfilled
   every plan, plumb from the garden of Eden, way before that. Before the foundation of the
   world, Jehovah spoke, and here come Jesus taking His pla-… taking the spot, and went out
   here, and come, and died, was made sin that you could be saved. How could you reject such
   matchless love as that blessed Redeemer, hanging yonder, the gobs of spit in His face, mockery
   and scandalized, and a crown of thorns on His head, an innocent Man, dying yonder, and the
   Blood dripping from Emmanuel’s veins, where sinners can plunge beneath the flood, lose all
   their guilty stains. 71 Shall we bow our heads. Heavenly Father, O God, with my heart turning
   around and around it seems, knowing that You’re here. See You move out over this audience in a
   form of a big, bright Light, speaking, visions breaking forth, knowing that the time is at hand,
   right now. Soon You shall send Jesus again, and He will come to this earth. “No man knoweth
   the minute or hour, not even the Angels, but the Father only.” And here He comes to the earth
   again, time way past due, like it was in the days of Noah, the longsuffering, when the ark was
   being prepared, wherein seven souls were saved,” or “eight.” Now, today His coming’s way
   
   33
   past due, way overdue, should’ve been here a long time ago. But God’s not willing that any
   should perish, but that all might come to repentance. 72 The doormat’s laid out, the welcome
   mat tonight, God’s plan of redemption through the offering up of the Blood of the Lord Jesus,
   once for all, to cleanse the guilty, unworthy sinner, and bring him in to reconciliation with
   God, and restore him back into the garden of Eden with his wife and his loved ones. Never to
   die no more, never to be sick, never to have a heartache, never to be no more funerals, no
   more graves to be dug. O God, no more weary, nothing, it’s all over. Washed in the Blood of
   the Lamb with this perfect assurance, that Jesus Christ once come under His Blood, we’re
   safe from the angel of death; it cannot touch us.
    JESUS CHRIST WOULD COME DOWN BY HIS HOLY GHOST AND INDWELL IN
   THAT PERSON AND BREAK THE POWER OF SIN AND DEATH! AND GIVE HIM
   VICTORY OVER THE THINGS OF THE WORLD. GLORY BE TO GOD! I’M SO
   THANKFUL FOR THE HOLY GHOST AND FOR THE POWER OF THE BLOOD OF JESUS
   CHRIST!
    Now brother, we’re made for mutual sharing. We’re sharing…we’re sharing things in
   common with Jesus Christ. One time, you didn’t have anything in common with Jesus Christ.

   now received the atonement.
    But now, the life from the LAMB HAS COME DOWN ON THE INSIDE OF… And we have

   common with him was, once you loved unrighteousness. Where once you loved the filthiness of
   the world. BUT NOW, GLORY TO GOD YOU LOVE HOLINESS AND NOW YOU LOVE
   THE THINGS OF JESUS CHRIST. And now the things that you have are in common with Jesus

   Now, this is to take place and be manifested in the last days, “when the mysteries of God
   should be finished,” as we’ll get to a little later. 52 These trees, the true vine and false vine!
   You’ve heard me preach on that since, from years ago, how they’ve growed up together. Brought
   them in individuals and showed that, from Cain and Abel, the two vines that met at an altar; both
   of them religious, both of them anointed, both of them desiring life, and worshipping the same
   God. And one was rejected and the other received. And the only way that the one that was
   received could have done anything different from his brother, it was revealed to him. For the
   Bible said, “By faith…” Hebrews, 11th chapter, “By faith Abel offered unto God a more
   excellent sacrifice than that of Cain, which God testified that he was righteous.” JESUS,
   SAID, THE SPIRITUAL REVELATION OF WHO HE WAS! “WHO DOES MAN SAY I
   THE SON OF MAN AM?” HE SAID, PETER SAID, “THOU ART THE CHRIST, THE SON
   OF THE LIVING GOD.” “Blessed art thou, Simon—Simon, son of Jonas; flesh and blood
   never revealed this to you. My Father which is in Heaven has revealed it. Upon this rock I’ll
   build My Church,” (what?) the true revelation of the Word. There is the true Vine again.
   “ABEL, BY FAITH!” YOU SAID, “IT WASN’T A REVELATION.” 53 WHAT IS FAITH?
   FAITH IS SOMETHING THAT’S REVEALED TO YOU; THAT IS NOT YET, BUT YOU
   BELIEVE IT WILL BE. FAITH IS A REVELATION OF THE WILL OF GOD. SO, BY
   REVELATION! 54 And the churches today don’t even believe in spiritual revelation. They
   believe in a dogmatic teaching of some system. “By revelation Abel offered unto God a more
   excellent sacrifice than that of Cain, which God testified he was righteous.” Amen. I hope you
   see that. See where we’re living? See the hour? I was talking to a—a gentleman not long ago, a
   Christian scholar and gentleman. He said, “Mr. Branham, we refuse all revelations.” 55 I said,
   “Then you have to refuse Jesus Christ, for He is the revelation of God, God revealed in
   human flesh.” Unless you see it, you’re lost. Jesus said, “Except you believe that I am He, you
   will die in your sin.” HE IS THE REVELATION OF GOD, THE SPIRIT OF GOD
   REVEALED IN HUMAN FORM. You can’t believe that, you’re lost. You put Him a third
   person, second person, or any other person besides God, you’re lost. “Except you believe that I
   am He, you will die in your sins.” A revelation! 56 No wonder they couldn’t see Him. “No man
   can come to Me except My Father draws him. And all the Father has given to Me,” in the roots,
   
   35
   “will come to Me.” See? You get it? Oh, how we should love Him, adore Him, praise Him; to
   see the fruit of the Spirit in the last days, and the Bride Tree ripening in the top of the time!
    Oh, then Bible said, “The sons of God begin to call upon the name of the Lord.” But it also
   went on and said, and the sons of God looked upon the daughters of men and saw that they were
   fair. And begin to take unto them wives of the daughters of men of Cain the seed of the serpent.
    Did you ever see an hour when there’s more beautiful women today then you ever looked at.
   You used to have two beautiful girls in the whole schools. But now brother, every girl in the
   school is beautiful almost. Why? Because it types the sons of God in this hour…The devil is
   trying to get the sons of God to lust upon the daughters of men.
    But bless my God, I’d rather be blind if I’m going to lust after them beautiful women out
   there. I’m so thankful that I have the Holy Ghost, that I’m filled me with his righteousness, I’m
   filled with his holiness. And now I’m holy because Gods holy! And we have a mutual
   companionship, we have a mutual fellowship. OH GOD NOW WE HAVE THINGS IN
   COMMON, because I love holiness and righteousness. And now I hate sin.
    And oh, if you women think you got a beautiful body and a beautiful figure you and you
   loved to see how pretty your legs is…You need to be healed one time and be filled with the Holy
   Ghost and let the great baptizer fill you…Not Audible… That the devil has over you. Oh when
   you see a woman sisters that thinks your dress is a little too old fashion and thinks your hair
   don’t look nice, you just remember, you got a fellowship, she ain’t got nothing! She ain’t got
   nothing and she’s a curse on her. She’s deceived of the devil and don’t know it.
    Eve was deceived of the devil. And the Bible said that Adam was not deceived. But Eve was
   deceived.

   24 God, here, was going to do something that He’d asked man to do. And God will never ask you
   to do anything, that He would not do Himself. Did you ever think of that? Did you ever go back
   to the garden of Eden in the great coming forth of Adam and Eve? The Bible said that Adam
   was not deceived. Adam was not deceived; he knowed just exactly what he was doing. But
   because of the love that he had for Eve, he walked right out into death with her. Not because he
   had to, he knowed different. Eve was absolutely deceived. She thought she was right. But Adam
   knowed better. But he walked out with her and took death with her. Was the—was a great sign
   that the Church, the Bride, was guilty. Christ was not guilty. But He become guilty to die the
   death for His Church. To redeem her He went to death with her.
    Oh, I’m so thankful! They can call me a Holy Roller, they can call you women old fashion

   62-0121M - And Thy Seed Shall Possess The Gate Of His Enemy
   William Marrion Branham
   238 He ascended on High. What did He do? He cut a hole, a gate, that, the prayer of this Seed of
   Abraham. Why? Why? If we be the Body of Christ, if we are dead, we reckon ourself dead and
   buried in Christ, and raised with Him in resurrection. He is the Head of the Body. Where the
   Head is, the Body is with It. And then, this morning, where every one that’s did that, “is seated
   with Him in heavenly places,” with the Royal Seed. Praise God. 239 No gates. You can’t pray
   this far, and say, “Oh, oh, there’s a word.” Huh-uh. They close you off, right there. 240 But if
   our heart condemn us not; if we know that we’re walking in the commandments of God; we
   see our lives cleaned up; we see it; every Word that God commanded, we keep It; then the
   gates of every enemy is possessed. “Then ask what you will, it’ll be done for you.” “He shall
   possess the gate of his enemy.” Oh, brother, what a church that would be! 241 When I come
   back again to Phoenix, if the Lord permits me, I hope, when I walk into this tabernacle, that
   these pews will be lined, and every pew in the full Gospel movement in this city will be lined
   with saints of the living God: look like Christian; talk like Christian; act like Christians; with
   the Spirit of God moving among them, where, if one would sin, the Holy Spirit call it out right
   then. 242 It’ll do it. You seen it in the prayer line, as up here on the altar. Where, say, “You go
   back there and make that right with your husband. Go, tell your wife that you was out, night
   before last, with that woman, setting on a certain-certain place.” If It’ll do it here, by walking
   in the Word, listening to that still small Voice, It’ll do it in you. You’re Abraham’s Seed. Then,
   no sin. 243 Preacher, wouldn’t you like to see that in your church? Walk in this church, and
   look down along through here, see both men and women, godly, saintly, setting there just
   charged with the power of God. Sin could not walk in. A man walk in and set down, the Spirit
   raise up and say, “John Jones, you come from so-and-so, a city, a certain-certain place. He’s
   here to find healing for his body. See? He did a certain thing at a certain place. He did this,
   and he take…has, take this back, make this right, then God will heal him of that cancer.
   THUS SAITH THE LORD.” My, my! 244 Give me a church, give me ten men, who, really
   jewels of God, the Royal Seed, put them men together, and watch what’ll take place. Give me
   this little houseful of people like that, and I’ll show you a Light that the world will run to it.
   That’s right. THAT’S WHAT GOD WANTS US TO BE. “YOU’RE A CITY SETTING ON A
   HILL.” YOU’RE ROYAL SEED OF ABRAHAM. “IT SHALL POSSESS THE GATE OF
   ITS ENEMY.” 245 SICKNESS, THERE’S A CAUSE FOR SICKNESS. THERE’S A CAUSE
   FOR THESE THINGS. AND GOD, THE HOLY SPIRIT, IS HERE TO REVEAL THAT
   THING AND TELL YOU WHY YOU DON’T GET IT. WHAT’S THE MATTER WITH US?
   We don’t have to wonder, “Will It do it.” It’s already doing it. What do you do?
    I pray to God, if I’m wrong, let it be known. If there be a wicked way in me call it out now
   and let me ask my brothers and sisters to forgive me and let me humble MYSELF before God. I
   WANT TO SEE GOD MOVE IN HIS PEOPLE! HE’LL WILL NEVER MOVE WITHOUT
   HOLINESS AND RIGHTIOUSNESS.
    Oh, I wish the ministers in this message would wake up! Ministers claiming to be leading the
   Bride and their women sitting there at the piano, dresses up over their knees. Boy, if there’s
   anything that greaves the Holy Ghost is to see a woman in the presence of God trying to stretch
   that material down over her knees. If a man of God is in your presence and the word of God is
   
   39
   coming forth and your stretching those dresses trying to get them down over your knees, you
   need your conscience, God is putting a red light in your conscience and telling you that your
   dresses are too short, then let them down. Can you say Amen? (Amen)
    But oh no, we’ll talk about the rapture and everything else. I know the devil don’t like it.
   Brother, I saw them get up and walk out from the churches with the prophet. They walked out in
   droves when he got on holiness. And that’s what cut him off from the world. They hated it, but
   God loves it. God loves it and his children loves it! Why? Because they have fellowship with
   him.
    Oh, one time or other, man has always broken his fellowship with God. He told Moses said,
   “Speak to the rock Moses and I’ll bring forth water” But Moses walked up there and the devil
   tempted Moses and he got upon him and he smote the rock. And he broke his fellowship with
   God. And God said “Moses, because you smote that rock, you’ll not go over into the promise
   land. He broke his fellowship with God.

   unto the rock before their eyes; and it shall give forth his water, and thou shalt bring forth to
   them water out of the rock: so thou shalt give the congregation and their beasts drink.
   9 And Moses took the rod from before the Lord, as he commanded him.
   10 And Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the rock, and he said unto
   them, Hear now, ye rebels; must we fetch you water out of this rock?
   11 And Moses lifted up his hand, and with his rod he smote the rock twice: and the water came
   out abundantly, and the congregation drank, and their beasts also.
   12 And the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron, Because ye believed me not, to sanctify me in
   the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore ye shall not bring this congregation into the land
   which I have given them.
    Oh Saul! Oh, I can imagine a fellowship Saul had. Whoever heard of Saul? Whoever heard of
   Saul? When Samuel went down to anoint him, he was so humble before God he was hid over
   there under the corn-shuck. And they said, “Where is Saul” Where is Saul? Saul come forth and
   be anointed of the Lord” Brother he was so humble he hid over underneath the corn-shucks.
   How many have got that kind humility today? Said, when the Lord God begins to bless, then out
   comes your chest, thinking that your somebody. But there’s ole Saul so humble hid underneath
   the corn-shucks. They had to go and say to Samuel, “Saul is hid under the corn-shucks Samuel”
   Samuel said, “Bring him out!” And he anointed him. And said, “Thus saith the Lord, you’ll go
   down the road and the spirit of God is gonna come upon you and your gonna prophesy.” Oh
   God! And the spirit of God come upon Saul and he had such a fellowship brother, he danced in
   the spirit all night long. He had a beautiful time. They said, Saul is numbered with the prophets,
   look what a fellowship he has with his God.
    Oh, but when God said, “Kill every beast, kill every animal, kill every boy and kill every girl.
   And then the church got on him and got pulling at him and he didn’t do what God told him to do.
   Is, that right? (Amen) And he come back and the prophet said, “Oh, Saul did you keep the word
   of the Lord?” Saul said, “Yes, Samuel I kept the word of God!” Then what’s the bleating of the
   sheep that I hear then? Saul said, “Well these we’re nice cattle, I thought the Lord God would
   want me to save them.” Samuel said, “You did wrong! The kingdom is rent from your hands and
   
   40
   is given to another that’s more faithful than thee.” Brother all the screaming and all the crying
   couldn’t change Gods mind. And he begged screamed and cried, but he had broken fellowship.
    Oh, and I think of David! That little David that killed the Lion, that little David that killed the
   bear, with such faith and Love in God. That little David that killed Goliath. That little David that
   killed the tens of thousands of his enemies. And God spoke out and said, “David you’re a man
   after my own heart!” But one day he went up on the house top, and he looked down over
   there…He wasn’t out on the battle field for God any more, he was luke-warm.
    And brother when your luke-warm and you leave the battle field of a prayer life, of fighting
   all these demons and devils, your heading for trouble. Your broken fellowship is on its way.
   Amen? (Amen)
    But David looked down there and he seen a beautiful woman named Bathsheba. He looked
   out there and he lusted after her and then brought her over and committed adultery with her.
   Amen! And there, after God had said David, you’re a man after my own heart, but now we’ve
   broke fellowship. Can you say amen? (Amen)
   The prophet come along and said, “David thou art the man!” A Broken fellowship
    Oh, then I think of Samson. What a fellowship he had with God. Samson was raised up to
   deliver his people. Brother, he killed the Philistines by the thousands. A little ole man that
   weighted about a hundred and twenty-five pounds. But he had seven locks of hair, which was the
   seven promises of God in every Church Ages. God in every church age, no matter how little you
   are or how bad the world talks about you or how little and insignificant you are, Gods given you
   a promise. That if you stay with my word, and be a Nasserite and live holy before me, I will
   anoint you with my spirit. What a fellowship Samson had. He beat down and killed a thousand
   Philistines with a Jaw bone of donkey. Amen! But then brother, the devil raised up a woman. See
   it’s a woman! The devil raised up a woman and there he went. He lusted after her and lost his
   anointing. Broke his fellowship with God, look at him down there blind. I could preach a
   message on that right there.
    Oh, but God, then begin to find a man again after his own heart when he found Joseph.
   Brother there’s nothing recorded against Joseph. Brother, they throwed him in a pit, he didn’t
   break fellowship. They sold him in Egypt, he still didn’t break fellowship. The ole devil raised
   up another woman. The devil said, “I always got Gods servants, seemed like with women. I’ll
   just try with this beautiful woman here” So, He sent this big ole beautiful woman in there and
   anointed her of the devil. And she tried to get Joseph to do a wicked thing. But he so feared God
   and loved holiness and righteousness. Brother, he was a young man and he didn’t have no wife.
   And ole Satan said, “I’ll sure get him with this! Oh, I’ll get him with this beautiful woman.” But
   what did Joseph do? Joseph tore out of that house running as hard as he could go.
    And brother that’s what we need today is MEN AND WOMEN, THAT WHEN THEY SEE
   THE DEVIL THEY’LL RUN TO THE WORD OF GOD, and run from that thing!
    No, broken fellowship with Joseph. And then I think of that great John the Baptist. Nothing
   recorded against ole John, but just a little bit of doubt creeped in his heart, that’s all. There the
   Bible said, “There was never a man born of a woman, as great as ole John. Brother, ole John
   hated the things of the world. He hated them ole denominations. He had such a fellowship with
   God that he forsook the world and went out into the wilderness brother. And he didn’t have no
   steaks or chops or hams or nothing but my God, he did have fellowship with God. Oh, God! He
   had such fellowship that he could eat wild honey and locust. Is, that right? He ate honey and
   locust. (Amen) But Glory to God when Jesus come, he gave him a great tribute. He said,
   
   41
   “THERE NEVER was a man born of a woman that was great as John.” Never-the-less, he that is
   least in this kingdom of God is greater than John.
   Luke 7:28-Reference quote:
   28 For I say unto you, Among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than
   John the Baptist: but he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.
    Oh, I know John Had fellowship. I know Moses had fellowship. I know Samson had
   fellowship. But he said, oh but there’s something coming. That all the prophets desired to see!
   All the earth is travailing for it and to see the sons of God that’s gonna be restored back into
   fellowship.
   Luke 10:24-Reference quote:
   24 For I tell you, that many prophets and kings have desired to see those things which ye see,
   and have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them.
   Romans 8:19-23-Reference quote:
   19 For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of
   God.
   20 For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath
   subjected the same in hope,
   21 Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the
   glorious liberty of the children of God.
   22 For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now.
   23 And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we
   ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.
    Oh, we see Jesus Christ there never was one like him. Brother, he stayed faithful to his father
   God he had a fellowship from the cradle right up until the grave. Can you say, amen? (Amen) He
   loved the Lord God. Why, when he was twelve years old, he was in the Temple, and his mother
   and father his earthy mother and father or so-called mother and father, was looking for him. And
   when they found him, they said “Son you worried your mother and father” He said, “Did ye not
   know that I am about my father’s business? I have fellowship with God.” Both asking questions
   to the Pharisees and answering them. Amen! But glory to God as he went on and he growed up a
   little more. We find him working right in the carpenter shop feeding his mother Mary and
   feeding the Family. But one day there come a call said, “Son it’s time for thee now to go to the
   Jordan. Oh, God and there he walked down the Jordan. And there the word of God come to the
   prophet to be washed by the water of the word. The word of God come down to the prophet and
   the prophet John Baptized him in the water. And the spirit of the Lord then drove him straight to
   the wilderness.
    Oh, God that’s what I desire, I pray to God that the spirit of God, would drive us from this
   world and into prayer that we would be able to live holy lives, and that we might see the
   resurrection sign of the Messiah.
    Bother he went to the top of the mountain. But that ole devil met his match this time brother.
   He tried to get him with women, he tried to get Jesus with everything. Brother, he couldn’t
   anoint no maiden strong enough to touch Jesus. He couldn’t touch him!
   
   42
   But oh, you say, “Jesus wasn’t tempted that way!” The Bible said, “He was tempted in all
   things.” He overcame, Amen! Brother, he had the same temptation you got. The only difference
   about him he had a greater desire then a lot of us today. Amen! He had a desire, he had one
   purpose, he had one purpose to please God. And there he was upon the mountain and Satan put
   everything at him that he could. He said, “If your hungry command these stones to be made
   bread, if you’re the Messiah?” Then Jesus said, “man shall not live by bread alone, but by every
   word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God must man live!” Is, that right? (Amen) He tried to
   get him with popularity. He tried to get him with popularity and he said, “The Lord thy God and
   him only shall I serve.” Brother Satan buffed up against something that day. Amen! He buffed up
   against a man that day that was determined to please God. And the Bible said, “That the Devil
   left Jesus for a space of time”
   Matthew 4:1-11-Reference quote:
   1 Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil.
   2 And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward an hungred.
   3 And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of God, command that these
   stones be made bread.
   4 But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word
   that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.
   5 Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple,
   6 And saith unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give
   his angels charge concerning thee: and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time
   thou dash thy foot against a stone.
   7 Jesus said unto him, It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.
   8 Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth him all the
   kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them;
   9 And saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me.
   10 Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the
   Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.
   11 Then the devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and ministered unto him.
    Brother, I don’t care how strong that devil comes, if you will resist the Devil, he will leave
   you for a space of a time. He’ll go find somebody else that he can get. You just keep resisting
   him, resist him. And resist the devil and he’ll flea from you. Bless his name!
   James 4:7-8-Reference quote:
   7 Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.
   8 Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify
   your hearts, ye double minded.
    Oh, we find, that this great fellowship that Jesus Christ had with God. Brother, we find out
   that it was never broken. It was never broken, but one time. Think of it! Never broken but one
   time. Oh, my friend, how you ought to esteem Jesus Christ. How you ought to love him.
    To think what a fellowship he had with God. When he was at the well of Samaria talking with
   the woman at the well, that Samaritan woman. When he talked to her, he was tired, he was
   
   43
   leaning upon the well, weary, dusty, thirsty and hungry. But along came along a little prostitute
   that was living with five husbands. Is, that right? (Amen) And oh he begin to talk to her. Jesus
   begin to get strengthened. He was giving out the word, he was giving out the words of life to a
   little prostitute.
   John 4:3-29-Reference quote:
   3 He left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee.
   4 And he must needs go through Samaria.
   5 Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that
   Jacob gave to his son Joseph.
   6 Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the
   well: and it was about the sixth hour.
   7 There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink.
   8 (For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.)
   9 Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of
   me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.
   10 Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to
   thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living
   water.
   11 The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from
   whence then hast thou that living water?
   12 Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself,
   and his children, and his cattle?
   13 Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again:
   14 But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that
   I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.
   15 The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to
   draw.
   16 Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.
   17 The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, Thou hast well said,
   I have no husband:
   18 For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that
   saidst thou truly.
   19 The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.
   20 Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where
   men ought to worship.
   21 Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this
   mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.
   22 Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews.
   23 But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in
   spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him.
   24 God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.
   25 The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when he is
   come, he will tell us all things.
   26 Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he.
   
   44
   27 And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man
   said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her?
   28 The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men,
   29 Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?
    And his apostles walked up and they we’re surprised that he was talking with a woman. And
   as he got done talking with her, the disciples said, “Lord Jesus come have something to eat. Jesus
   said. “I already ate.” They said did somebody give you something to eat? One of the other
   apostles fed you? He said, “I have meat to eat of, that ye know not of”
   Oh God! And that meat was to do the will of his father which is in heaven! He was having
   perfect fellowship with God; he never broke that fellowship.
   John 4:30-34-Reference quote:
   30 Then they went out of the city, and came unto him.
   31 In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat.
   32 But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of.
   33 Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him ought to eat?
   34 Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.
    Until he put the cross upon his back and was heading up Golgotha’s hill. And there brother, in
   the Garden of Gethsemane God begin to leave Jesus. (Brother Lambert weeps, as he speaks)
   Fellowship was beginning to be broken. WHY? BECAUSE HE DISPLEASED GOD,
   BECAUSE HE HAD SIN IN HIS LIFE? NO! HE WAS A LAMB, HE WAS THE LAMB OF
   GOD, PERFECT WITHOUT SPOT WRINKLE OR BLEMISH. BUT ALL MY BLIMISHES
   AND ALL MY SPOTS AND ALL MY SINS, ALL MY SHORT-COMINGS, ALL MY
   MISTAKES WAS UPON HIM. And THERE HE WALKED TO CALVERY without God!
   GOD SEPERATED HIS FELLOWSHIP! GOD BROKE HIS FELLOWSHIP with his son. And
   there he went Calvary and the nails went into his hands. He didn’t have any help for the pain! He
   felt the pain of the nail, he felt the pain of the nails in his feet! He heard the curses; he heard all
   the bad things that the people said about him. And when they hung him up and that ole poll
   dropped down in that hole and the cross shook, he felt the pain and the agony of his weight of his
   body hanging upon them nails. And he cried out! Oh, in his eyes and he said, “Oh God I’ve
   never broke fellowship with you Lord! God, I’ve never done anything wrong! There’s no sin in
   my life! My God, My God, why hast thou forsaken me?” AND THEN THE WORDS SPOKE
   BACK TO JESUS, SO, YOU CAN BRING MANY SONS INTO FELLOWSHIP WITH ME!
   And he said, “Lord it’s finished!”

   William Marrion Branham
   53 But God transfered all of our sins upon Him, and He died. And because HE DIED A
   SINNER, the bible said, “his soul went to hell.” That’s right. And while He was there, He
   preached to—to those that were in prison, that repented not in the longsuffering of days of Noah.
   54 “But it wasn’t possible that He would leave His body see corruption, neither His soul in
   hell.” And on the third day, He rose up for our justification. Showing to us, that as our faith is
   
   45
   confessed in Him, and we’ve been born anew of the Spirit, that as sure as He come from the
   grave, we’ll rise also in His second Coming. Oh, what a perfect hope!

   55-0227A - The Position Of A Believer In Christ
   William Marrion Branham
   12 Say, one thing again, I want to share while it comes on my mind. A minister or two has called
   up, got a hold of my manager and so forth, about the other night when I made a remark (I’m sure
   that it was misunderstood.), that—about Adam and Eve. Now, it was said that—thought that I
   said that Adam hadn’t sinned. Adam was sinned, and condemned, and was driven from the
   garden of Eden by God. See? The redemptive robe over him showed that. See? Well, what I
   said, that Adam sinned wilfully. See? See, Eve was actually deceived. But Adam was not
   deceived. He deliberately sinned (See?); deliberately sinned, knowing what he was doing,
   because of his wife. He took position with his wife. Then they went before God and both of
   them was condemned. And Jesus, not ignorant of what He was doing, came down, and took
   His place with the sinner, the Church, that He might redeem the Church back to Himself.
   See? See, I said it was a type. Adam was the—was… CHRIST IS THE SECOND ADAM.
   WHERE THROUGH FIRST ADAM ALL DIE; THROUGH SECOND ADAM ALL LIVE. 13
   But the misunderstanding was they thought that I said that Adam never sinned. But Adam did sin.
   But he did it with his eyes wide open. And instead… In Timothy 3 it said that Adam was not
   deceived. But the woman, being deceived, was in the transgression. See? Eve actually thought
   she was right. But Satan deceived her. But he didn’t deceive Adam. He knew it was wrong. But
   because of the love for his wife, he represented hisself with sin and was condemned by the
   same. And cast out of the garden of Eden. And Christ represented Hisself with the Church full
   of sin, and was condemned, and His soul went to hell. That’s right. And God raised Him up on
   the third day. You believe that? See? It wasn’t that he didn’t sin; he did sin. And Christ was…
   He never… God wouldn’t have sent Him to—to hell pure. He had to send Him to hell
   condemned (See?), because He took our sins. AND CHRIST DIED, NOT RIGHTEOUS;
   CHRIST DIED A SINNER. See? Christ never sinned Himself, but HE TOOK OUR SINS ON
   HIM. 14 Any Scripture theologian teacher would know the scapegoat, and—of the Old
   Testament and so forth. He was both… I know you have that brethren here believes that the devil
   was the scapegoat. But no, no. No, Christ was both goats (That’s right.), both death and
   resurrection. You see? And He bore our sins away, and then come forth in the resurrection.
   And so it was Christ being represented for the Church. He took the Church’s place of sin, and
   was cast into outer darkness, into hell, and rose again the third day. God raised Him up for
   our justification. And He did that on the basis of one Scripture. And of a minister who later
   backslid, spoke the Scripture. David said, “I will not leave His soul in hell, neither will I suffer
   My holy One to see corruption.” The only Scripture I find in the Old Testament, spoke by
   prophecy that God was going to do it. So He did not leave His soul in hell. 15 And the reason
   Jesus knew that within three days He would raise up… Now, some people said, “Why, He said
   He was in the grave three days.” Why, He died on Friday afternoon, raised up on Sunday
   morning, just one day and part of another. See? But He never said just exactly three days, for He
   knew the type of Jonah being in the belly of a whale was His type, and He knew that David said,
   “I’ll not leave My holy One see corruption.” And He knowed that corruption sets in in seventytwo hours. And sometime within that three days and nights, God was going to raise Him up,
   
   46
   ’cause He would not corrupt. See? So He died on Friday afternoon, rose up on Sunday morning,
   because God promised that not one cell of His flesh would corrupt, and He rose up again. Amen.
   Now, do you love Him? With all of my heart it’s so.
    But oh, don’t know about you? I LOVE HOLINESS, I LOVE RIGHTEOUSNESS, I LOVE
   MY JESUS, AND I PRAY TO GOD, THAT I CAN STAY FORTIFIED BEHIND HIS WORD!
   AND I SAY, “SHAME ON THIS CHURCH WORLD! ONE DAY THEY’LL REAP WHAT
   THEY SOW WHEN THEY SEE JESUS WALK IN THEIR MIDST ONCE AGAIN IN
   PERFECT FELLOWSHIP WITH HIS SON AGAIN AND THEY SEE THE CREATIVE
   WORD OF GOD MADE MANIFESTED BEFORE THEIR eyes they’ll weep and wail!
   Broken fellowship God and son. All the sins of the world was upon him.

   An Exposition Of The Seven Church Ages - 3 - The Ephesian Church Age
   William Marrion Branham
   “Who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks.” How meaningful are those words
   when viewed in the light of the Scripture, which describes Him as “Christ Who is our Life.” For
   Christ, indeed, is the life of the church. She has no other life. Without Him she is simply a
   religious society, a club, a meaningless gathering of the people. As a corpse bejeweled and
   dressed is still a corpse, so the church, no matter what her programs and her gracious efforts
   might achieve, without Christ she is a corpse also. But with Him in her midst, with Him
   motivating her, she becomes to the wonderment of all “His body, the fulness of Him that
   filleth all in all.” And this very hour He is walking in the midst of the last age’s golden
   candlestick. What He was as He walked in the first age He is even now in this last age. Jesus
   Christ the SAME, YESTERDAY, and TODAY, and FOREVER. “Seven golden candlesticks.”
   In Exodus 25:31, it says, “And thou shalt make a candlestick of PURE gold: of BEATEN
   work shall the candlestick be made: his shaft, and his branches, his bowls, his knops, and his
   flowers, shall be of the same.” THE TRUE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST, THE BRIDE, IS
   LIKENED TO PURE GOLD. HER RIGHTEOUSNESS IS HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS. HER
   ATTRIBUTES ARE HIS OWN GLORIOUS ATTRIBUTES. HER IDENTITY IS FOUND IN
   HIM. WHAT HE IS, SHE IS TO REFLECT. WHAT HE HAS, SHE IS TO MANIFEST.
   THERE IS NO FAULT IN HER. SHE IS ALL GLORIOUS WITHIN AND WITHOUT.
   FROM BEGINNING TO ENDING SHE IS THE WORK OF HER LORD, AND ALL HIS
   WORKS ARE PERFECT. IN FACT IN HER IS SUMMED UP AND MANIFESTED THE
   ETERNAL WISDOM AND PURPOSE OF GOD. How can one fathom it? How can one
   understand it? Though we cannot do that, we can accept it by faith, for God hath spoken it. But
   not only is the candlestick of gold, it is of BEATEN gold. Hand-crafted of beaten gold,
   according to her blue prints which were Spirit-given. Outside of her Lord and Master, Jesus
   Christ, was ever a people so beaten and purged as the bride of Jesus Christ? Surely she is
   filling up the sufferings that Christ has left behind. Her goods are despoiled. Her life is in
   jeopardy. She is accounted as sheep for the slaughter. She is killed all the day long. She
   suffers much, but in it all retaliates not, neither does she cause others to suffer. Worthy of the
   Gospel is this lovely bride of Christ. And as gold is malleable, whereas brass will break with
   the beating, this gold of God will bear her suffering for the Lord, not bowed, not broken, not
   destroyed, but formed as a thing of beauty and a joy forever by the trials and testings of this
   
   47
   life.

   Now notice. But at THE OPENING OF THE SEVEN SEALS, REVELATION 10, THE FULL
   WORD IS TO BE BORN INTO MANIFESTATION AGAIN, AND VINDICATED BY THE
   SPIRIT OF GOD, IN THE FULL STRENGTH AS IT WAS WHEN HE WAS HERE ON
   EARTH; MANIFESTED IN THE SAME WAY, DOING THE SAME THINGS THAT IT
   DID WHEN IT WAS HERE ON EARTH. Amen! Hebrews 13:8, said, “Jesus Christ is the same
   yesterday, today, and forever.” In Saint Luke 17:30, Jesus said, “In the last days, as it was in
   the days of Sodom, when the Son of man will be revealing Himself again, it’ll be the same
   thing.”
    And oh, I think about how many like Judas at the table of Jesus Christ. Where Jesus said,
   “Have not I chose you twelve and one of you is the devil. He sold Jesus for thirty pieces of
   silver. How many preachers have sold that fellowship down the drain brother for the gold and
   silver of popularity? For the gold and silver of their Cadillac’s and their big congregations and
   popularity.

   But here not long ago, there was a great sum of money (Many of you heard about it.) was
   given to me, and I refused to look at it. I could have made all of you happy, just pick
   through…?… now among us… A million five hundred thousand dollars. See? I even refused
   to look at it. See? They packed an article of it in the paper. But I—I didn’t want it. It isn’t
   money. A man that gets his mind on money, popularity, and things like that, he’s surely on
   the outside. There’s three things I’ve noticed in reading history, that wrecks a minister’s
   life from the start: one of them is money, the love of it. The next is popularity. When he
   thinks he’s something, when he’s nothing anyhow. And the next is women. That’s right.
   Man takes money, women, popularity. That’s been the three major things that God’s had
   trouble with His children. Many of the other things that goes along with it too. But the main
   thing is when God begins to bless a brother and give him something a little more than—or
   something another to help the people, then the man begins to think, “See who I am?” Right
   then he’s on his road down. You want me to tell you how to get up? Get down. The way up is
   go down. He that humbles himself, God will exalt. Is that right? He that exalts himself will
   be made abased.

    Oh, but give me Jesus! Let me walk with him, oh God! If I NEVER, IF NEVER NOBODY
   EVER HEARS ME, let me walk with him. Let me fellowship with him.
    Oh, God and I think of what Jesus said, I know that your hearts are sad! Smite the shepherd
   and the sheep will be scattered and the world shall rejoice. That’s right, what did he do brother?
   The word of God condemned them of their sin and of unbelief. Is, that right? (Amen) The words
   of Jesus condemned them ole preachers and churches. And when he was dying they rejoiced over
   his death. But there was a hundred and twenty that was crying, THEY WE’RE SAD!
    And the Bible said, in the last days that the word would be crucified again. And the
   denominations would rejoice because THE WORD HAD SHOWED THEM THAT THEY
   WASN’T UNDERNEATH THE BLOOD OF THE WORD. IT SHOWED THEM THEY
   WE’RE LOST! IT SHOWED THEM THINGS IN THE WOMEN, IT SHOWED THE
   BACKSLIDDEN PREACHERS WHERE THEY WAS AT.
   Exodus 29-39, 41-Reference quote:
   39 THE ONE LAMB THOU SHALT OFFER IN THE MORNING; AND THE OTHER
   LAMB THOU SHALT OFFER AT EVEN:
   41 And the other lamb thou shalt offer at even, and shalt do thereto according to the meat
   offering of the morning, and according to the drink offering thereof, FOR A SWEET SAVOUR,
   AN OFFERING MADE BY FIRE UNTO THE LORD.
   Numbers 28:3-8-Reference quote:
   3 And thou shalt say unto them, This is the offering made by fire which ye shall offer unto
   the Lord; two lambs of the first year without spot day by day, for a continual burnt offering.
   4 THE ONE LAMB SHALT THOU OFFER IN THE MORNING, AND THE OTHER LAMB
   SHALT THOU OFFER AT EVEN;
   5 And a tenth part of an ephah of flour for a meat offering, mingled with the fourth part of an hin
   of beaten oil.
   6 It is a continual burnt offering, which was ordained in mount Sinai for a sweet savour, a
   sacrifice made by fire unto the Lord. 7 And the drink offering thereof shall be the fourth part of an hin for the one lamb: in the holy
   place shalt thou cause the strong wine to be poured unto the Lord for a drink offering.
   8 And the other lamb shalt thou offer at even: as the meat offering of the morning, and as the
   drink offering thereof, thou shalt offer it, a sacrifice made by fire, of a sweet savour unto
   the Lord.
   Exodus 12:1-8-Reference quote:
   And the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt saying,
   2 This month shall be unto you the beginning of months: it shall be the first month of the year to
   you.
   3 Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth day of this month they shall
   take to them every man a lamb, according to the house of their fathers, a lamb for an house:
   4 And if the household be too little for the lamb, let him and his neighbour next unto his house
   take it according to the number of the souls; every man according to his eating shall make your
   count for the lamb.
   5 Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year: ye shall take it out from the
   sheep, or from the goats:
   
   49
   6 And ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month: and the whole assembly of
   the congregation of ISRAEL SHALL KILL IT IN THE EVENING. 7 AND THEY SHALL TAKE OF THE BLOOD, AND STRIKE IT ON THE TWO SIDE
   POSTS AND ON THE UPPER DOOR POST OF THE HOUSES, wherein THEY SHALL
   EAT IT. 8 And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and unleavened bread; and with
   bitter herbs they shall eat it.

   63-0707M - The Indictment
   William Marrion Branham
   150 What did they do? They took a Barabbas, a murderer, instead of the Son of God, at the day
   of the first crucifixion. 151 AND TODAY THEY ARE TAKING SOME MAN’S WORD,
   WHICH IS A LIE AND THE WAY OF DEATH, AND REFUSING TO TAKE THE WAY OF
   LIFE, GOD’S WORD. I CONDEMN THIS GENERATION, INDICT IT, IN THE WORD OF
   THE LORD, THAT THEY’RE WRONG. THEY’RE GUILTY OF CRUCIFIXION, OR
   TRYING TO CRUCIFY THE SPIRIT. 152 They call for a revival, everywhere. HOW YOU
   GOING TO HAVE A REVIVAL WHEN THE WORD ITSELF CAN’T WORK THROUGH
   THE PEOPLE? I’d like for somebody to answer that for me. How can it do, when you deny the
   very Revival Itself? Well did the prophet speak of them, “forms of godliness.” Their own forms,
   back there, denied the Word of Life. Their own forms, today, deny the thing that can bring
   them a revival; their creeds and forms. Yes, sir. 153 They take the denomination and their
   creeds instead of the—the Word, and that crucifies His Word and makes His Word of no effect to
   the people. When they see the Word of God so vividly and just place Itself, that God made the
   promise He would do this, and here He is doing it, and they make fun of It and get away from
   It, it’s blasphemy. And they try to crucify the Word Itself.

   64-0125 - Turn On The Light
   William Marrion Branham
   119 We are back to that time again, brothers and sisters. We’re back to that hour again.
   Notice. Why? Same cause. 120 We find that the—these great lights that we’ve lived in, in the
   days gone by, they were all right, we have nothing against them. But, this Laodicea Church Age,
   be careful, remember, it is a Christ-rejected. And that’s exactly what it is now. 121 This great
   council has moved around, to unite all the Protestants together, this ecumenical move. And what
   is it doing? It’s blackening out the very Word, itself, and the Word is Christ. How can they do?
   When, the Christian Science, and United Brethren, and many of them people in other great
   organizations, some believe the virgin birth, some don’t, some believe this and that. How can
   you join yourself with unbelief? “How can two walk together unless they be agreed?” Come out
   from among them and be separated, and take God’s Holy Word and stay by It. 122 Jesus
   Christ is obligated to manifest His Word. The thing we need today is a rising of Malachi 4.
   Another prophet will rise in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and will produce exactly what
   He promised to do. Then, man blindly will forsake It and walk right into the darkness, as they’ve
   always did. 123 Watch now, we find out, the same cause, that today, that they reject, the
   
   50
   churches reject the Message, crucify the Word, take the Word out. Now if you don’t belong to
   it, you can’t even—you can’t even have your church. They’ll close it down. You’ve got to come
   into it. If you don’t do it, you’re closed down. Then what about it? Oh, stand for That which is
   right! REMEMBER, IT’S CRUCIFIXION TIME AGAIN, NEARLY. 124 False light caused
   the greatest—the greatest robbery the world ever had, in England, not long ago. The greatest
   robbery that was ever performed, was done by a false light. Seven-million-dollar robbery was
   done by a false light that slowed that train down, and Scotland Yards couldn’t find the man. They
   got away with it, so slicky. That was known as the greatest robbery that was ever done by
   robbers, in the natural. It robbed the world, of its greatest robbery. 125 And the greatest
   robbery that was ever done to the church of Jesus Christ, is done by false light, a glare of some
   other age, and rejecting the Light that’s predicted for this age. Amen. False light, a glare of
   yesterday! Don’t walk in the glare of yesterday. Walk in the warmth of the Son today. Don’t
   pull yourself down into a denominational shade, saying, “The days of miracles has passed.” 126
   Jesus said, “These signs shall follow them that believe: in My Name they shall cast out devils,
   they shall speak with new tongues. These signs shall follow them.” 127 They say, “It’s all right
   for the apostles; not for us.” That’s a glare. 128 Jesus said, “These signs shall follow them that
   believe, to all the world.” Yes, sir. 129 Now what’s the matter? Walking in a glare, it’s caused
   the greatest robbery, it’s taken the Christ from the church. See, how can Christ manifest
   Hisself in a Word that’s promised today, by some cold creed of yesterday? IT DOESN’T
   WARM THE SEED. NO, SIR. THE CHURCH’S GREATEST ROBBERY! 130 WARM?
   AND, REMEMBER, THAT COLD CREED LIGHT WILL NOT RIPEN THE SEED OF
   TODAY. IT DENIES THE SEED. It’s the fog that’s upon the earth, the denseness. IT’S TIME
   FOR GOD TO RISE AND TURN ON THE LIGHT AGAIN, MAKE HIS WORD TO LIVE.
   CERTAINLY, LIGHT! THAT COLD CREED WON’T RIPEN THE GRAIN. IT
   CERTAINLY WON’T.
    And then when the word died this time, the man that carried the word, they rejoiced. They
   said, “The wrath of God fell upon him because he had the wreck.” Little Branhamites, what are
   they gonna do now? Don’t worry about it. I said Jesus is getting ready to appear among his
   people. HE’LL PROVE ONCE AGAIN WHICH IS RIGHT AND WHICH IS WRONG.
   I said, Jesus Christ is gonna prove to this denominational world that he loves Miss Jesus.

   An Exposition Of The Seven Church Ages - 5 - The Pergamean Church Age
   William Marrion Branham
   IN THESE LAST DAYS THE TRUE BRIDE CHURCH (CHRIST’S SEED) WILL COME TO
   THE HEADSTONE, AND SHE WILL BE THE SUPER CHURCH, A SUPER RACE, AS SHE
   NEARS HIM. THEY IN THE BRIDE WILL BE SO MUCH LIKE HIM THAT THEY WILL
   EVEN BE IN HIS VERY IMAGE. THIS IS IN ORDER TO BE UNITED WITH HIM. THEY
   WILL BE ONE. THEY WILL BE THE VERY MANIFESTATION OF THE WORD OF THE
   LIVING GOD. Denominations cannot produce this (wrong seed). They will produce their creeds
   and their dogmas, mixed with the Word. This mongrelizing brings forth a hybrid product. THE
   FIRST SON (ADAM) WAS THE SPOKEN SEED-WORD OF GOD. HE WAS GIVEN A
   BRIDE TO REPRODUCE HIMSELF. THAT IS WHY THE BRIDE WAS GIVEN TO HIM,
   TO REPRODUCE HIMSELF; TO PRODUCE ANOTHER SON OF GOD. But she fell. She fell
   
   51
   by hybridization. She caused him to die. THE SECOND SON (JESUS), ALSO A SPOKEN
   SEED-WORD OF GOD WAS GIVEN A BRIDE LIKE AS WAS ADAM. But before He could
   marry her, she also had fallen. She, like Adam’s wife, was put to the test whether she would
   believe the Word of God and live, or doubt the Word and die. She doubted. She left the Word. She
   died. FROM A LITTLE GROUP OF THE TRUE SEED OF THE WORD, GOD WILL
   PRESENT CHRIST WITH A BELOVED BRIDE. SHE IS A VIRGIN OF HIS WORD. SHE IS
   A VIRGIN BECAUSE SHE KNOWS NO MAN-MADE CREEDS OR DOGMAS. BY AND
   THROUGH THE MEMBERS OF THE BRIDE WILL BE FULFILLED ALL THAT WAS
   PROMISED OF GOD TO BE MADE MANIFEST IN THE VIRGIN. THE WORD OF
   PROMISE CAME TO THE VIRGIN MARY. BUT THAT WORD OF PROMISE WAS HE,
   HIMSELF, TO BE MADE MANIFEST. GOD WAS MADE MANIFEST. HE, HIMSELF,
   ACTED AT THAT TIME AND FULFILLED HIS OWN WORD OF PROMISE IN THE
   VIRGIN. It was an angel that had brought her the message. But the angel’s message was the
   Word of God. Isaiah 9:6. HE FULFILLED AT THAT TIME ALL THAT WAS WRITTEN OF
   HIM BECAUSE SHE ACCEPTED HIS WORD TO HER. THE MEMBERS OF THE VIRGIN
   BRIDE WILL LOVE HIM, AND THEY WILL HAVE HIS POTENTIALS, FOR HE IS THEIR
   HEAD, AND ALL POWER BELONGS TO HIM. THEY ARE SUBJECT TO HIM AS THE
   MEMBERS OF OUR BODIES ARE SUBJECT TO OUR HEADS. NOTICE THE HARMONY
   OF THE FATHER AND THE SON. Jesus never did anything until it was first showed Him by
   the Father. John 5:19. This harmony is now to exist between the Groom and His bride. HE
   SHOWS HER HIS WORD OF LIFE. SHE RECEIVES IT. SHE NEVER DOUBTS IT.
   THEREFORE, NOTHING CAN HARM HER, NOT EVEN DEATH. For if the seed be
   planted, the water will raise it up again. Here is the secret of this. The Word is in the bride (as it
   was in Mary). The bride has the mind of Christ for she knows what He wants done with the
   Word. She performs the command of the Word in His name for she has “thus saith the Lord.”
   Then the Word is quickened by the Spirit and it comes to pass. Like a seed that is planted and
   watered, it comes to full harvest, serving its purpose. Those in the bride do only His will. No one
   can make them do otherwise. They have “thus saith the Lord” or they keep still. They know that
   it has to be God in them doing the works, fulfilling His own Word. HE DID NOT COMPLETE
   ALL HIS WORK WHILE IN HIS EARTHLY MINISTRY SO NOW HE WORKS IN AND
   THROUGH THE BRIDE. She knows that, for it was not yet time for Him to do certain things
   that He must now do. BUT HE WILL NOW FULFILL THROUGH THE BRIDE THAT WORK
   WHICH HE LEFT FOR THIS SPECIFIC TIME.
    Oh, the world rejoiced but the saints we’re sad. No more fellowship with Jesus, he’s gone!
   They wept and they cried, and they gathered up in the upper room crying. Oh, but they had that
   taste of restoration of fellowship.
    While they was crying and sad, the two on the way to Emmaus said, “Oh, wasn’t it
   wonderful, how we used to hear him talk, oh you remember the sermon on the mountain. You
   remember how he stilled the waves. You remember the time when he said, Lazarus come forth!
   Oh, you remember how he broke the bread and multiplied the fish. Oh, you remember the time
   when he turned the water into wine.” Oh, we’ll never see that again. And about that time
   someone come by, a man and he begin to talk with them and they begin to feel something
   burning down in their heart. By that time, they had talked all evening. They found a little Inn and
   they went in and sat down and they had something to eat. And they gave him some bread and
   they begin to eat. And about that time, when they looked down and seen those hands and seen
   
   52
   the nail prints in his hands, brother something quickened down inside of them and their heart
   begin to leap for joy. And when their heart leaped for joy he disappeared. Brother, they jumped
   up and run out that night and straight back to Jerusalem. Hallelujah, we have seen him we had
   fellowship with him. He broke the bread and we seen the nail prints in his hands.
    Oh, Thomas, doubting Thomas jumped up and said, “Oh, I’ll never believe it. I’ll never
   believe it unless I can feel the nail prints in his hands!” That’s just about like a lot of doubting
   Tomas’s today. Amen? (Amen) A lot of doubting Thomas’s today.
    Yeah, once again he’s gonna appear and they’re gonna say, “I don’t believe he’s appeared,
   I’ll have to see it” They’ll see it! Don’t you worry about it!

   17 Wonder if you little boys or some of you could tell me who the third man was that had that
   Spirit? Could you do it? Huh? Any student there can raise your hand and tell me who the third
   man was that had that same Spirit? Huh? John the Baptist. He came out of the wilderness.
   Jesus said, “This is the Elijah which was spoke of was to come restore all things.” And it made
   Elijah—made John dress just like Elijah, perhaps acted like him, but John did no miracles.
   And that same Spirit is predicted to come on the earth today again the second time. And I
   believe that it’s on the earth today. And it is preaching a great message of repentance through a
   mighty man of God who does no miracles, speaks not of miracles, but blasting the world down
   with a message of repentance. AND FOLLOWING JOHN CAME JESUS, not preaching too
   much, not much of a preacher, but was performing signs and wonders as a vindication that
   John’s ministry was in season and a vindicated. SO WE’RE THANKFUL TO THE LORD TO
   BE LIVING TO SEE THE DAY THAT HISTORY REPEATS ITSELF AGAIN. And we’re
   living in that day.

   145 And He spoke down on the river, He said, “AS JOHN THE BAPTIST WAS SENT
   FORTH TO PROCLAIM THE COMING OF CHRIST, AT THE END OF HIS MINISTRY,
   JESUS CAME. AND AS JOHN WAS SENT, SO WILL YOUR MINISTRY FORERUN THE
   SECOND COMING OF CHRIST.” And there’s been a universal revival amongst the people of
   God, throughout the world, in the last fifteen years; the longest revival. Any historian knows that
   no revival lasts over three years. And this is fifteen years. And look at the church today, it’s
   cooled off. We’re waiting for His Coming. He is a vindicating Himself, showing.
    And about that time ole Thomas talking like that, Jesus appeared and come and walked right
   up to Thomas. “Look a here, Thomas, look at the nail prints in my hands. Reach hither thy hand,
   and put it in my side. I am he! I’ve come back to fellowship with thee. Have you got any meat to
   eat here? Have you got any meat, I ain’t no spirit, I’m that Jesus!” He sat down and he ate meat
   of fish and broke bread. You talking about joy! They had joy! Is, that right? (Amen)
   
   53
    But that wasn’t the half of it. He said, “Go down here to Jerusalem and you tarry there in the
   upper room. You tarry there don’t go anywhere, I’m gonna give you some more joy. This ain’t
   over yet, this has just begun.”
   Luke 24:36-49-Reference quote:
   36 And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace
   be unto you.
   37 But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit.
   38 And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?
   39 Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not
   flesh and bones, as ye see me have.
   40 And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them his hands and his feet.
   41 And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here any
   meat?
   42 And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb.
   43 And he took it, and did eat before them.
   44 And he said unto them, These are the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you,
   that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and
   in the psalms, concerning me.
   45 Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures,
   46 And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from
   the dead the third day:
   47 And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations,
   beginning at Jerusalem.
   48 And ye are witnesses of these things.
   49 And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem,
   until ye be endued with power from on high.
   And the worlds still rejoicing, but your sadness is gonna be turned into joy.
   Are you getting what I mean church? (Amen) The denominations are still laughing! And we
   we’re sad but brother, but that joy begin to come. We feel his presence in our midst. We see the
   word of God going forth and it’s cleansing us from all sin. Is, that right? (Amen) We are
   sanctified by the washing of the water of the word.
    AND IN EVENING TIME HE WILL APPEAR AGAIN, he’ll walk right among us again! I
   say Jesus Christ is gonna appear right in your midst. He’s gonna show you the nail prints in his
   hands. You talk about, you ain’t gonna have faith for the rapture? Your gonna have it brother!
   When you see the nail prints in his hands and you feel the print in his side. Oh yes, he’s gonna
   appear again in bodily form to catch the little Bride away. Oh, hallelujah to God! Don’t you want
   to see him? We long to see him! (Amen)

   54-0811 - Show Us The Father
   William Marrion Branham
   “Satan,” said Jesus, “give Me the keys of death and hell. You don’t possess them.” “Oh, yes I
   do. I possess them, because back yonder in the garden of Eden, Adam sinned.” But He said,
   
   54
   “I’m the virgin born Son of God. I come down from the Father’s bosom. I’ve just died yonder
   on Calvary, and My Blood’s still dripping from the cross. I come down to take over.” That’s
   right. “You ain’t scaring nobody from this on. You was a bluff one time. You had them, but you
   haven’t got them anymore. I’m the possessor.” That’s right. “I’ll give My church the keys to
   the Kingdom.” Reached over on his side, pulled the keys off of him, smacked him in the face, and
   sent him back, and shut the door so hard it shook the soot pegs of hell in his eyes. Hallelujah. 45
   He’s the Conqueror since He rent the veil in two. You ain’t bluffing Him. He knows where
   He’s at. I can see Him coming back up. It’s coming towards daylight. There’s some more
   people up there, the Old Testament saints. They couldn’t go to heaven. They had to stay in
   Paradise, ’cause the blood of bulls and goats won’t take away sin. It just covers sin. But Jesus
   has shed His Blood that divorces sin, puts her away, wipes her out. I can see Him. There’s
   another place up there called Paradise. I can hear the door [Brother Branham knocks six
   times—Ed.] Somebody says, “Who’s there?” Open the door Abraham. Said, “Sarah come here;
   come here, Sarah. That’s the Man that I entertained that day under the oak tree.” Hallelujah.
   There He is. That’s Him. Daniel said, “What’d you say? Well, well, that’s the Rock that I saw
   hewed out of the mountain without hands.” 46 There come Ezekiel say, “I seen Him, and He
   was in the heavens, and the clouds looked like dust under His feet.” He said, “Boys, you all
   have believed under the shedding of the sacrifices of blood of bulls and goats, but sin is divorced
   now.” We’re going up. Don’t you remember what David said in the Psalms? ‘He let captive
   captives and give gifts to man.’?” “Yes, I remember what David said. I believed it too. “I know
   you did, come on.” I hear Abraham say, “Lord, the God of Abraham.” Oh, my, I can hear him
   say, “Can we make a little whistle-stop in Jerusalem? “Yes, I got forty days. I want to instruct
   My disciples. They got to go in the world and cast out devils and things. I better talk to them a
   little while before the going up. So you fellows can just walk around a little while. Hurry up
   now. It’s coming towards daylight, be Easter morning pretty soon.” 47 My, I can see the big
   morning star a looking around over the skies, comes down like a whirlwind, hits on the grave,
   and open comes the grave. And angels stood there… He rose up and so did the Old Testament
   saints. The Bible said so. Matthew 27 says, “Many of those who slept in the dust of the earth,
   rose and come with Him, after His resurrection. Abraham, Isaac, Jacob (Hallelujah.) went in
   with Him after the resurrection. My, I can see Him stand over there as they come from Emmaus
   and was talking. He walked along with them and beat them back over there, walked right in the
   room and said, “Touch My hand, see… Give Me something to eat. Give Me a piece of bread and
   fish. Does a spirit eat like I eat?” 48 I can see Abraham and Sarah with their arms around one
   another coming down the street, said, “Sarah, the old place don’t look like it used to. Nope. It
   feels good to be back here again doesn’t it, Sarah?” “Yes, sir, it sure does.” Caiaphas, I can see
   him standing there, a high priest saying, “This racket about that resur… Say, who is that—that
   young couple—couple going there?” Abraham says, “Sarah, we’re recognized.” Vanished out
   of there with that same kind of a body just like His own glorious body. We’re going to have
   one, one of these days. Hallelujah. Just like He went through the wall without seeing… He
   vanished out of their sight.

   William Marrion Branham
   67 Look back yonder when Adam was leaving with his sweetheart, going out under
   condemnation, with a shadow—a shadow of redemption somewhere, because there was blood
   running over them. Somewhere there was a shadow; he knew it. And I hear something going
   [Brother Branham claps—Ed.]. What is it? It’s the old, bloody sheepskin beating up and down
   on his legs, speaking of some time. “There’s a land beyond the river, that they call the sweet
   forever, and we only reach that shore by faith decree…” KNOWING THAT SOMEDAY,
   THEY’D GET BACK INTO EDEN AGAIN. AND NOW, AS I SEE HIM GOING YONDER
   NOW, THE SECOND ADAM GOING UP THE HILL, THE LITTLE SPOTS ON HIS BACK.
   THEY GET BIGGER, BIGGER, BIGGER, AS HE WALKS ON. What is it? After while they
   all go into one spot. I hear something beating again. [Brother Branham claps—Ed.] What is it?
   THERE GOES THE SECOND ADAM, NO MORE THAN JEHOVAH HIMSELF, WHO
   COMES DOWN AND WAS MADE FLESH (TO WHAT?), EVEN TO GO TO HELL WITH
   HIS SWEETHEART, TO REDEEM HER BACK TO THE ONE WHO…?… CHRIST TO
   REDEEM HIS BRIDE. Hallelujah! He seen it in Adam yonder. AND HE COME DOWN,
   WAS MADE FLESH, KINFOLKS WITH US, THAT HE MIGHT MARRY THE HUMAN
   RACE TO HIMSELF. There He is, going yonder to Calvary. 68 As He’s moving up the hill, and
   His poor, little shoulder rubbing, the old bee of death humming around Him, “It ain’t going to
   be long till I’ll get Him.” Buzzing all around and around, and after while it had to sting Him.
   But, friend, you know, if a bee ever stings anybody deeply, he can’t sting no more. He pulls his
   stinger out. So he hasn’t got no more stinger. And I tell you, that’s the reason God was made
   flesh, here on earth, in order to hold the stinger of death. And now the—death has no more
   sting. The bee can swarm and buzz, but he can’t sting. “O death, where is thy sting? GRAVE,
   WHERE IS THY VICTORY?” BUT CHRIST, THE KINSMAN REDEEMER HAS MADE A
   WAY OF ESCAPE FOR EVERY BELIEVER ON THIS EARTH TODAY. The bee might hum;
   the bee might buzz; the bee might try to make you afraid. But I can point yonder to Calvary,
   where God Himself was made flesh, when HE HELD THE STINGER OF DEATH, AND
   TOOK MY PLACE AS A SINNER, AND PAID THE PRICE. AND HE LAID OUT THE
   WELCOME MAT TO ME TO COME HOME. “Whosoever will, let him come and drink from
   the fountains of the waters of Life freely. He that comes I will in no wise cast out.” 69 Oh, my,
   no wonder Paul could say, when he heard the axes out there, being sharpened… When I stood in
   his cell a few days ago, where they chopped his head off, and they was bringing the axe in, the
   old bee humming around him. He said, “Now, I got you.” He said, “Death, where is your
   sting?” It was left in Calvary, yonder. “Grave, where is thy victory? But thanks be to God, Who
   gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.” “God so loved the world that He gave,” so
   loved… Adam so loved Eve that he went out with her. Christ so loved the Church that He went
   with her. “God so loved the world…” Adam went with Eve, and her wrong; she was wrong. He
   knowed the wrong, he was innocent, but she was guilty. But Adam said, “I’ll go with her.” And
   Christ looked at the Church, and knowing it was wrong, yet Christ went with us to take our
   place yonder as a sinner, to die for us, to take the sting out of death for us. Sinner, how can
   you reject such matchless love? 70 No wonder Job said, “I know my Redeemer liveth, at the last
   days He’s going to stand upon the earth. And though the skin worms destroy this body, yet in my
   flesh shall I see God. I’ll see Him for myself; my eyes shall behold and not another.” Do you
   
   56
   believe it tonight? Our time’s a swayed from us. Oh, how the Holy Spirit seem to be moving in
   my heart. I can’t think of nothing, friends, nothing no greater, than how that Jesus come
   down here on earth and made the way of redemption, and fulfilled every plan, plumb from the
   garden of Eden, way before that. Before the foundation of the world, Jehovah spoke, and here
   come Jesus taking His pla-… taking the spot, and went out here, and come, and died, was
   made sin that you could be saved. How could you reject such matchless love as that blessed
   Redeemer, hanging yonder, the gobs of spit in His face, mockery and scandalized, and a crown
   of thorns on His head, an innocent Man, dying yonder, and the Blood dripping from Emmanuel’s
   veins, where sinners can plunge beneath the flood, lose all their guilty stains. 71 Shall we bow
   our heads. Heavenly Father, O God, with my heart turning around and around it seems, knowing
   that You’re here. See You move out over this audience in a form of a big, bright Light, speaking,
   visions breaking forth, knowing that the time is at hand, right now. Soon You shall send Jesus
   again, and He will come to this earth. “No man knoweth the minute or hour, not even the Angels,
   but the Father only.” And here He comes to the earth again, time way past due, like it was in the
   days of Noah, the longsuffering, when the ark was being prepared, wherein seven souls were
   saved,” or “eight.” Now, today His coming’s way past due, way overdue, should’ve been here a
   long time ago. But God’s not willing that any should perish, but that all might come to
   repentance. 72 The doormat’s laid out, the welcome mat tonight, God’s plan of redemption
   through the offering up of the Blood of the Lord Jesus, once for all, to cleanse the guilty,
   unworthy sinner, and bring him in to reconciliation with God, and restore him back into the
   garden of Eden with his wife and his loved ones. Never to die no more, never to be sick, never
   to have a heartache, never to be no more funerals, no more graves to be dug. O God, no more
   weary, nothing, it’s all over. Washed in the Blood of the Lamb with this perfect assurance, that
   Jesus Christ once come under His Blood, we’re safe from the angel of death; it cannot touch
   us.
    Oh God, I’m so thankful that God…Now, that beautiful fellowship they had when they went
   out of the upper room. A couple hundred years past, and they was still having fellowship. But the
   fellowship began to die down little by little. And finally, that ole antichrist spirit took over at
   Nicaea Rome. Is, that right? (Amen) There they took away the name of Jesus Christ. There they
   took away predestination and eternal security and the seed of the serpent and all the true
   apostle’s doctrines, they took it away. And when they took away the word of God, they took
   away the fellowship of Jesus Christ. Hello now! We went through all them dark church ages, but
   God, said in the word, “I WILL RESTORE THAT FELLOWSHIP, I WILL RESTORE THAT
   JOY saith the Lord!”

   144 “Whosoever shall take one Word away from It, or add one to It.” Hallelujah! Christ wants
   His Wife pure with the Word. [Brother Branham knocks on the pulpit four times—Ed.] That’s the
   way She must be. 145 Cause, nothing, not one tot, or one jittle, or anything, or tittle, will pass
   from that law, or from that Book, till It’s all fulfilled. Jesus said, “Both heavens and earth will
   pass away, but My Word shall never pass.” 146 Don’t put any private interpretation to It. He
   wants a pure, unadulterated, not even a flirt. I wouldn’t want my wife flirting with some other
   
   57
   man. And when you go to listening to any kind of reasons, beyond That, you’re listening, you’re
   flirting with Satan. Amen! Don’t it make you feel religious? [Congregation says, “Amen.”—Ed.]
   God wants you to stay unadulterated. Stay right there with that Word. Stay right with It. All
   right. 147 God promised to her, as He did to Eve in the garden of Eden, to this last Eve here.
   Which, the pentecostal church, the beginning of the church, the church itself, is the mother of all
   of the living people, because, as long as they go in there. But, you see, when they take up her
   sins, they die with her. 148 Here comes a little fellow along. He say, “I—I want to serve God.”
   149 They say, “Well, here is what you do. Go down there and repent.” “All right, I’ll do it.
   Glory to God!” Go down there, repent. 150 “Now come join us.” There, there you are. Uh-huh.
   See? That got it. Huh! That’s right, died right with it. See? See? That’s just…That’s what this
   Book is teaching, see, not what I’m saying. Because, It says Here, so. All right. 151 Now, God
   has promised her, as He did Eve. He told Eve there would come a time that the—the Word
   would come back to her again. Now you remember that? What she lost from, it would be
   restored. Cause, there’s only one Thing can restore, and that’s the Word. Exactly. 152 I said,
   shoot a gun; if you don’t hit the target, find where it went off at. You got to come back there
   and start again. See? 153 And if you go back, you go to Nicaea. That’s where you start again,
   see. Go back, away from them organizations, away from all that church. And we been seeing
   these Seals just perfectly. 154 I always wondered, all my life, why I was so against
   organizational systems. Not the people, no. The people are just like me or you, or anybody else.
   But that system, that denominational system, now I see it right here. I never knowed it till now.
   And that’s right. 155 GOD PROMISED THE SPIRITUAL EVE, THE SAME AS HE DID
   THE NATURAL EVE, THAT AGAIN THE WORD WOULD BE RESTORED TO HER. IN
   THE LAST DAYS HE WOULD RESTORE TO THE CHURCH, TO THE ORIGINAL WORD
   AGAIN.
   
    And God…and God finally found a little man called William Branham down in
   Jeffersonville, I KNOW THE DEVIL DON’T LIKE HIS NAME! But I said, He found a little
   man named William Branham down in Jeffersonville Indiana and God told him and said, “Don’t
   defile your body don’t drink or smoke or do anything evil. There’s a work for you to do when
   you get older.

   137 That’s the One met the requirement. Grace produced the Person of Jesus Christ. And we
   find, this Book now…God stretched His tent, come from God, to become a Man. He changed His
   strain, from the Almighty, to be a Man; to take on the form of man, so He could die, to redeem
   man. Wait till we see Him, when there’s “nobody worthy.” See? All right. 138 In the Bible, in
   the Book of Ruth, as you read it, you’ll find out, such a person was called the “goel,” g-o-e-l.
   Was called the goel, or, it was a person that could meet the requirements. And the goel must be
   able to do it, must be willing to do it, and must be a kinsman, next to kinsman, to do it. 139
   And God, the Creator, of Spirit, became kinfolks to us when He become man, in order that He
   could take our sin upon Him, and pay the price, and redeem us back to God again. There it is.
   There is the Redeemer. 140 CHRIST HAS REDEEMED US NOW. We are now redeemed. But
   He has not claimed His possession yet. Now, you might differ with that, but just hold on a
   minute, see. We’ll see. See? He hasn’t claimed it. See? IF HE TOOK THE BOOK OF
   REDEMPTION, EVERYTHING THAT ADAM HAD AND EVERYTHING THAT HE LOST,
   CHRIST REDEEMS BACK. AND HE HAS ALREADY REDEEMED US. BUT HE HASN’T
   TOOK THE POSSESSION YET; HE CANNOT UNTIL THE TIME APPOINTED. AND
   THEN WILL COME THE RESURRECTION, AND THEN THE EARTH WILL BE
   RENEWED AGAIN. And then He’ll take possession, His possession which He got when He
   redeemed us, but will do it at the appointed time. Oh, my! 141 This is described in this SevenSeal Book that we’re talking of now. All right. The Book of Redemption, it’s all described in
   here. All that what Christ will do at the end will be revealed to us this week, in the Seven Seals, if
   God will let us. See? All right. It will be revealed. And revealed, as the Seals break and are
   released to us, then we can see what this great plan of redemption is, and when and how it’s
   going to be done. It’s all hidden in this Book of mystery here. It’s sealed, got up with Seven

   said, “As it was in the days of Sodom,” now watch close, “in the days of Sodom, so will it be at
   the coming of the Son of man, when the Son of man is being revealed.” Not no more as a
   church, see, not no more; the Bride is called, see. “In that day, the Son of man will be
   revealed.” What? To join the Church to the Head, unite, the marriage of the Bride. The
   Bridegroom call will come right through this, when the Son of man will come down and come
   in human flesh to unite the two together. The Church has to be the Word, He is the Word, and
   the two unites together, and, to do that, it’ll take the manifestation of the revealing of the Son
   of man. Not a clergyman. I—I don’t know, I…Do you see what I mean? See, it’s Son of man,
   Jesus Christ, will come down in human flesh among us, and will make His Word so real that
   it’ll unite the Church and Him as one, the Bride, and then She’ll go Home to the Wedding
   Supper. Amen. She’s already united, see, we go to the Wedding Supper, not to the marriage.
   “…fill your flesh…self, of all the flesh of mighty men, ’cause the marriage of the Lamb has
   come.” But, the Rapture, is going to the Wedding Supper. When, the Word here unites with the
   person, and they two become one. And then what does it do then? It manifests the Son of man
   again, not the church theologians. The Son of man! The Word and the Church becomes one.

   the people, and millions will never know about it. It always has been that way, and it always
   will be that way. THEN THEY'LL WONDER SOMETIME, "WELL, I DIDN'T… I REALLY
   DIDN'T KNOW IT." GOT EYES, BUT CAN'T SEE.

   54-1203 - The Law Having A Shadow
   William Marrion Branham
   82 Our kind loving Father, we pray that You’ll heal the sick and the needy here in the meeting
   tonight. Thinking of the days, and seeing Your great Spirit move on the people and heal the sick,
   and give the blind sight, and take them from the stretchers, cots, and wheelchairs around the
   world. And the kings, potentates and monarchs… The world shaking and quivering tonight,
   under the impact of a great revival sweeping the land, and the people is letting it pass right by
   and not receiving it, just like they let the Son of God go by the gates, and the palace, temples,
   and so forth AND THEY DIDN’T RECOGNIZE THAT IT WAS HIM. And oh, if they could
   come back to earth tonight for another trial. But while He’s passing by tonight condemning sin
   in the flesh, people raising their hands and recognizing that they’re not just where they should be
   in Thee, I pray, God, that You’ll heal every sick person here. May Thy Spirit be upon them, and
   may they be perfectly normal and well.
    Oh, but our sadness has been turned into joy every day and soon he will appear in our midst.
   The mystery of the seventh seal will be open. We will see Jesus Christ, prove which is Bride and
   which isn’t.

   65-0418M - It Is The Rising Of The Sun
   William Marrion Branham
   04 We have put too much stress on the Mechanics and nothing on the Dynamic. It needs the
   dynamic Power of God, the resurrection Power of Jesus Christ upon the Church, to manifest and
   to bring to pass that This is gasoline. It might be in a gasoline can; it could still be water, see.
   But the only proof of it, is, put this Life on it, and It’ll prove whether it’s gasoline or not. 105
   And when you try to put the Holy Spirit in a denomination, you are as much as trying…You can
   get a splutter; you’ll ruin your engine, by getting it full of carbon. 106 But, oh, I’m so glad that
   there is a ten thousand octane Power, the Word of God and a Holy Ghost to light It up, and to
   resurrect the Power of God into a man’s life, or a woman’s life, or into a church. That shoved
   that Cadillac down the road yonder, under the dynamic Power of the Holy Ghost which came
   back and was waved over the people at the Day of Pentecost, making Him the same yesterday,
   today, and forever. 107 There was the first Sheaf come up from all the prophets, which was the
   
   65
   Son of God, the King of all prophets. 108 There has been churches, churches, brides, brides,
   churches, brides, brides. 109 BUT THERE HAS GOT TO COME ONE! HALLELUJAH!
   THERE HAS TO COME A REAL BRIDE! THERE MUST COME ONE THAT’S NOT
   ONLY GOT THE MECHANICS, BUT THE DYNAMICS OF IT, MAKES THAT CHURCH
   LIVE, MOVE IN THE POWER OF HIS RESURRECTION. Until we come to that place, until
   we find that place, what good does it do to polish the hubs? What good does it do to give her a
   facelift or a simonize job, when there’s no Dynamics in it? No matter how much the Mechanics
   prove to be right, there has got to be a Dynamics to make It work. 110 That’s what He proved!
   Hallelujah! That’s what Easter proved. HE WASN’T ONLY THE WORD, BUT HE WAS GOD
   HIMSELF, THE DYNAMICS, IN THE WORD. THAT MADE THE BODY OF JESUS
   CHRIST (COLD, STIFF, AND DEAD, IN THE GRAVE) SHAKE INTO LIFE AND RISE
   AGAIN, AND ROLL AWAY THE STONE. “I AM HE THAT WAS DEAD,” SO DEAD TILL
   THE SUN SAID HE WAS DEAD, THE MOON SAID HE WAS DEAD, THE STARS SAID
   HE WAS DEAD. ALL NATURE SAID HE WAS DEAD. AND NOW THE WHOLE WORLD
   HAS TO RECOGNIZE THAT HE’S ALIVE AGAIN. He was not only the Mechanics, God’s
   Word, He was the Dynamics to prove It. 111 And as He, being the Groom, the Bride has to
   come forth, ’cause It’s part of Him. And It can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all
   the revelations any others has spoke of the Bride; It can only manifest. IF IT DOES
   SOMETHING DIFFERENT FROM THE GROOM, IT ISN’T THE BRIDE. BECAUSE,
   SHE IS FLESH OF HIS FLESH, BONE OF HIS BONE; LIFE OF HIS LIFE, POWER OF
   HIS POWER! SHE IS HIM! As man and woman are one, and woman taken from his side; She
   had taken a Spirit, the feminish Spirit, from Him. The flesh from His side, made both Mechanics
   and Dynamics, the Wife. The Spirit of Him and the flesh of Him, and put it together, and made
   Mechanics and Dynamics. Until the church or the people… 112 All these Easter bunnies, and
   ceremonies, and big churches, and finery, will fail and pass away. 113 Until that Church
   becomes both Dynamics and Mechanics; and the Spirit of God, that moved Him, to do the
   things that He did! If He hit on sixteen cylinders, so will the Bride. Amen! For He said, in
   John 14:12, “He that believeth on Me, the works that I do shall he do also. I’ll give him a
   charge of My Dynamics, in his Mechanics, that the world will not be able to withstand it; and
   I’ll raise him up again at the last day.” That’s the Easter Message, the Dynamics and the
   Mechanics, together! The Mechanics without the Dynamics, no good; neither is the Dynamics,
   without the Mechanics. 114 You can scream and shout, and jump up-and-down, all you want to,
   and deny this Word, it won’t do any good. You’re just cranking around the—the pistons of…Got
   the spark there to fire, but no gasoline to fire it by. 115 It’ll only work as they come together.
   Amen! So, one will set still, and the other One will go up. That’s the only thing there is to it. Yet,
   they both might look alike, both claim to be churches, both claim to be Bride. But One has
   Mechanics and Dynamics, It brings it to pass, of what He said is the Truth. 116 It just won’t
   move, no matter how good the Mechanics is, until the Dynamics come. When the Dynamics
   come, that Fire is made to connect with that octane in the gasoline. And when That explodes,
   it causes a combustion, and that combustion moves every motion, every move, for He is the
   same yesterday, today, and forever. That’s the resurrection. That’s the real Power of God,
   Mechanics with the Dynamics. Notice, “It’s the Spirit that quickens.” It’s the—it’s the Spark
   that fires. It’s not the gas that fires; it’s the Spark that fires the gas. See? 117 “You can do
   nothing without Me; but with Me you can do all things.” As He is the Word, It’s the Father
   living. “Father sent Me, so send I you. As the Father has fired Me and pushed Me into
   everything, I do only that which is pleasing to God. Now, as He sent Me, so send I you with the
   
   66
   same Mechanics, and it takes the same Dynamics to operate It. And these signs shall follow
   them that claim to have the Mechanics. The Dynamics will take Its place.” 118 Paul said,
   “The Gospel came to us not in Word only,” through gasoline only, “but through Spark also,”
   to make It move. There you are. It came to us in that manner.
    How many here this morning as you heard the word something was down in your heart
   burning in you. Maybe you haven’t been lining up with all the word. And with every head bowed
   and every eye closed. God knows, when you raise that hand, he knows the desires of your heart.
   If you want Brother Bob to pray for you, that you haven’t lined up with that. Look at the hands
   everywhere! And you want prayer, God bless you! God, bless you! You want that perfect
   fellowship with Jesus, you don’t never want to break it. You want to stay fortified right behind
   that word. Look at the hands! Let us pray. You just pray out to God the way you want to pray as
   I pray for you. Don’t be afraid to cry out. You got something moving down in there, you want
   something from God, you just cry out an say, “Lord God give it to me”
    Heavenly father we felt the quickening of your spirit this morning. We feel the power that’s in
   the word Lord. You said, “Is not my word like a hammer that breaketh the rock into pieces?”
   Jeremiah 23:29-Reference quote
   29 Is not my word like as a fire? saith the Lord; and like a hammer that breaketh the rock in
   pieces?
    Lord God you said you we’re like a refiner's fire, and like fullers' soap: Lord you washed us
   this morning with the washing by the water of the word of God.
   Zechariah 13:9-Reference quote:
   9 And I will bring the third part through the fire, and will refine them as silver is refined, and
   will try them as gold is tried: they shall call on my name, and I will hear them: I will say, It is
   my people: and they shall say, The Lord is my God.
   Malachi 3:3-Reference quote:
   2 But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he appeareth? for he is
   like a refiner's fire, and like fullers' soap:
   3 And he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver: and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and
   purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness.
    Gracious Heavenly father, bless this thy people today Lord all those that’s had broken
   fellowship God. May that broken fellowship be restored. May every life God, that you’ll take us
   back to Eden Lord. Oh, Master God, reach down this morning by your love and grace, by your
   loving hands Jesus. Put your arms around them Lord, encourage them Lord. Speak peace to their
   heart, let them feel the joy of God, bubbling up in their soul. Oh, Master God give strength and
   grace to the little ones Lord to overcome Lord. Heavenly father help the women. May the little
   women of this assembly be the best dressed Lord, the holiest Lord looking women that there is
   Lord. I don’t mean legalism Lord. But I mean from the inside out God. Not from the outside, but
   from the inside. Lord God not a measuring stick Lord of the world, but the measuring stick of the
   world of the word father not the world. Help us to measure up to the word father. Oh, Master

   God, I pray for each one, every hand that went up Jesus. If I could help them Lord this morning
   do anything I’d do it, but it takes you. Without you we can do nothing Lord.
   John 15:5-Reference quote:
   5 I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth
   forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.
   Reach down this morning father, bless your little ones. Jesus how we pray that you’d soon come
   after us. In Jesus Christ name we pray, amen.
    Do you love him? (Amen) Do you Love his word? (Amen) I love him, he means everything,
   it’s my life. And if you don’t receive it, how can you have the blood. Because the bloods in the
   word. Don’t you see it? The washing by the water by the blood of the word.
    When the spear went into the side of Jesus the word, what came out of the word? (Water)
   When the prophet brought the word, what come out of it? You have been begotten through the
   word. Come on now! What did he say? You’ve been begotten through the word. The Blood is in
   the word.
   James 1:18-Reference quote:
   8 Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of

   56-0120 - Fellowship With God Through Reconciliation
   William Marrion Branham
   34 “If ye abide in Me, and My Word in you, ask what you will, and it shall be given unto you.”
   There’s the secret of it. THERE’S THE SECRET OF THAT GREAT LIFE THAT’S HID
   AWAY IN GOD, that knows no fear, whether it’s stormy, whether the clouds are over, or
   whether the moon’s not shining, or the sun’s not shining, they’re still living in that Shekinah
   glory. Amen. There you are, the fellowship. Then the blood of this heifer… First she must be
   without a spot, without a blemish, speaking of Christ. Then she was to be killed in the evening
   time, and before the high priest, Eleazar. And that’s a type of Christ: killed in the evening, and
   before the high priest, as he witnessed through the death. The red, as I spoke of, speaks of
   redemption. And then the high priest was to get her blood on his hands, and go up to the door
   of the tabernacle, and make seven stripes across the door with the dead heifers blood, speaking
   of the seven junctions, or the Seven Church Ages that’s to come. We’ll get on that later in the
   week, a little later on, of the junction times, and show that we’re living right now, in the seventh
   junction…?… We’re at the end time. How that God’s Word proves it, and history follows it
   right down to the very shadow. And the very revival that’s sweeping the world today is the
   beginning of the end time. 35 How that the high priest struck this over the door, then the heifer
   was to be burnt, that’s hoofs and all. And it made what they call the water of separation. Then
   every time an Israelite had sinned, they had to be sprinkled with this water of separation. And it
   
   68
   was to be kept in a clean place, which speaks of the minister’s heart. And felt the worshipper
   coming to the tabernacle for fellowship, if he’d lost his standing with God, and was away from
   God, and an alien, the only way that he could have fellowship again was first come back to the
   outer courts and be sprinkled with the waters of separation, which speaks of the Word. We’re
   washed by the water of the Word, through the washing of the—by the water of—by the Word.
   Makes us a separated. The first thing that sinner does is come first and hear the Word. “Faith
   cometh by hearing, hearing of the Word of God.”

   62-0121E - The Marriage Of The Lamb
   William Marrion Branham
   194 It’s a sweet, kind, reverent spirit to the Word of God, “washed by the water of the Word,”
   and the Word in you. It’s a washing. Amen. The church needs a washing, a full-Gospel
   washing. That’s right. Not just a part washing, but a full-Gospel washing, cleaned up, “made
   new creatures in Christ Jesus.” 195 Jesus’ Bride is not a dirty bride. He wouldn’t have His
   dirty, Bride. 196 If a woman come up to get married, and she looked like she’d come out of the
   pig pen out there; a man that’s got any dignity about him, wouldn’t marry her. He’d make her
   clean herself up. 197 And when the church of Christ comes up to get married, thinks she’s going
   in the Bride, with all the world tagging onto her, Christ’s Bride won’t be like that. No, sir. I must
   hurry. 198 Neither is Church of Christ, of the Lord Jesus Christ, that Church is not a ragged
   Church, either, with worn-out rags of denominations. She don’t have to be a member of some
   great denomination. SHE HAS TO BE BLOOD-WASHED, BLOOD-BOUGHT. Not saying we
   belong to the biggest church, the biggest organization, or this, that, or the other. SHE’S GOT
   TO BE PURE, SANCTIFIED, HOLY, WITHOUT SPOT OR WRINKLE, BY THE BLOOD
   OF HER—HER SAVIOUR, JESUS CHRIST. 199 Like Esther, the hidden Man in the heart,
   the hidden Man, the meekness and gentleness of the Spirit of God, in the human heart; not the
   glory and class of the world. 200 I’ve always said the world shines; the Gospel glows. Oh, it’s a
   million miles apart. Hollywood shines; the Church of Christ glows with loveliness, and soft,
   and sweet, kind. That’s right.
   
   
    Now what if you don’t want to be washed by that word? How can you make it? You can’t,
   it’s impossible! You’ve got to except it. How many except these words? (Amen) God bless your
   heart. How many just love one another? My, my ain’t that wonderful!
    I found my place! I can just preach as hard as I want to, and everybody still loves me! (Amen)
   Thank you, glory to God! See, the reason preachers can’t preach like this, their afraid they’ll get
   run off. I’m so glad, I’m so glad nobody is offended in your pastor. I’m so glad, I’m so glad, that
   I ain’t got a trustee board that come up this morning and said, “We’re gonna take your salary
   away” I’m so glad I don’t get no salary! You know what would of happen this morning if I’d
   been out there? One of the trusties would come up and pulled on my coat. “Wow, listen now Bob
   watch out now, don’t get to… you know what… you got four children to feed there.” I’m so
   glad! I’m so glad I’m free! Ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free!
   John 8:32-Reference quote:
   32 And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.
   
   69
   Why are we sitting here this morning? Because we’re free! We don’t have nobody telling us
   what to do. My, I love him! He’s here! He’s here! You say, “What is that in their midst?” That’s
   Jesus! One day you’ll really see him.

   65-0718M - Trying To Do God A Service Without Being The Will Of God
   William Marrion Branham
   And today He is standing among us, in the Person of the Holy Ghost, manifesting Hisself more
   and more, coming into His Church, making Hisself known; because, Him, and the Bride and the
   Groom will be the same, making Hisself known. AND ONE DAY YOU’LL SEE THAT THE
   ONE THAT YOU FEELED IN YOUR HEART, AND SEE HIS IDENTIFICATION, WILL
   BECOME PERSONALIZED BEFORE YOU, THEN YOU AND HE ARE ONE.
   
    Let’s sing that song, “Oh What a fellowship.” Ain’t this wonderful fellowship? (Amen) We
   got things in common with Jesus.
   Congregation sings. “Leaning on His Everlasting arm”
    Are you leaning on that everlasting arm? (Amen) Oh what a fellowship! Oh, what a joy
   divine! Brother when you get in fellowship with the word, it’s Joy! Joy Unspeakable! Some
   people have joy in darkness, they have no light. Jesus is the light of the world. He is the word.
   And I’m so thankful for the word of God that lights up my pathway. It’s the word of God that
   lights up your pathway. I tell you where he’ll be lead you, straight into New Jerusalem. Oh, don’t
   let your pathway get dark, it’ll lead you down to the Broadway of the denominations. Won’t it?
   (Amen) Then you won’t have fellowship with the word, it won’t lead you to Eternal Life.
    How about let us sing “Amazing Grace?” (Yes) That Jesus was at Calvary. Let’s close our
   eyes and sing it to him. Let your heart reach out and praise him for it, carrying your load to
   Calvary.
   Congregation sings, “Amazing grace.”
    Isn’t he wonderful! Oh, Jesus is the sweetest name I know. Let’s just sing one more little
   hymn and then I’ll turn you lose. I just hate to leave you. “Holy is the Lord” and mighty is his
   name. He’s a holy God. We ain’t got no holiness. But when you get a Holy God inside of you
   then you got holiness. I ain’t got nothing, but when you got a holy God in you, then what have
   you got? Now you see on the outside, shows what’s on the inside. But now you can try to act like
   you got something on the outside and not have nothing on the inside. That’s like taking chicken
   feathers and sticking them in a peacock, like peacock feathers in a chicken. Right? (Amen) But
   oh when you by love get a hold of God on the inside, he’ll clean the outside up.
    I guarantee every woman in here at one time cut her hair, but when they heard the word they
   changed. Yeah, one time we watched Television but when we heard the word. We may not had
   no prayer life, but when we heard the word we changed. How many tonight have broken
   fellowship? Listen! When you get dust on your Bibles, you got broken fellowship. When you sit
   and watch television, you got a broken fellowship. When you got a husband and wife fussing
   with one another, you got a broken fellowship. But oh my, when you keep those trusted virtues,
   the Bride loving the word eating the word, praising God, feeding upon prayer and holiness. What
   have you got? Proves you got a holy God inside you. Amen? (Amen) Just stay with it. My!

    Congregation sings, “Holy Is the Lord”
    Let’s just bow our heads now. Brother Irv Shaw, would you dismiss us in a word of prayer
   our precious brother?
